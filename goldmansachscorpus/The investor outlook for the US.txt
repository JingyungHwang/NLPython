How global stock markets are projected to change 	
	
	

	

In the coming decades, US GDP may be surpassed by that of China and India, but US stock market capitalization is   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c921 still projected to lead the world , according to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c922 Goldman Sachs Research .

Demographic projections and long-term drivers of productivity can help us glimpse how the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c924 global economy  may look 50 years in the future. By 2075, the US may be the only western country in the top five economies — a group that may be dominated by Asia and potentially include Nigeria, say Kevin Daly, co-head of Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa Economics in Global Macro Research, and economist Tadas Gedminas. 

China and India's populations of more than a billion inhabitants each matter a lot for GDP. China's population, for instance, is about four times larger than that of the US. For the country's GDP to be as large as the US's, GDP per person only needs to be about one-quarter that of the US GDP-per-person. “It's actually not that high a bar, because China's population is so much larger,” Daly says. 

But GDP is only one measure of economic heft. The US is forecast to remain twice as rich as China and India in 50 years. Real GDP per capita in other developed countries will also remain much higher than their emerging market counterparts in the coming decades.

Rich countries tend to have bigger stock markets: Goldman Sachs Research finds that there's a statistical link between ratios of equity market capitalisation-to-GDP and GDP-per-capita. While its share of global market cap will decline, the US equity market is projected in 2075 to still be some 60% larger than China's, the next-biggest.   
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

March QuickPoll: A big shift in sentiment 	
	
	

	

Investors are turning bearish on US growth even as they become more optimistic about European investment opportunities, according to the latest Marquee QuickPoll which surveyed 531 institutional clients from March 3 to 5. Key findings include:  

Rising risks.  Investor sentiment took a sharply bearish turn in March, reaching levels not seen since the onset of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle in 2022. Geopolitics and tariffs were cited as the biggest risks by 62% of investors surveyed. 

Sticky inflation . Investors increased their inflation expectations on the back of tariff developments, with about two-thirds of investors (up from 52% in January) expecting core US inflation to end the year above 2.5%. 

US pre-eminence fading?  While US recession worries have picked up, investors are growing more upbeat on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c926 European growth , and German defense spending in particular.

Goldman Sachs Research  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c929 raised its forecast  for the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92a euro zone's  real GDP growth this year to 0.8%, up from 0.7%, driven by a new fiscal plan in Germany and higher defense spending on the continent. Our economists increased their 2026 forecast for the currency area by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3%, and boosted the 2027 numbers by 0.3 percentage points to 1.6%. 

The fiscal plan from Europe's largest economy includes a €500 billion ($542 billion) off-budget infrastructure and climate protection fund and increased defense spending, which could boost economic activity across the region. Sven Jari Stehn, Goldman Sachs Research's chief European economist and his team increased their forecast for real GDP growth in Germany this year to 0.2% from flat. They also raised their 2026 forecast by 0.5 percentage points to 1.5% and the estimate for 2027 increased by 0.6 percentage points to 2%.

What credit markets are telling us 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92c 

Lotfi Karoui (L), Goldman Sachs Research's chief credit strategist, with Allison Nathan on Goldman Sachs Exchanges 
	
	
	

	

Bond markets are beginning to price in more economic risk, according to Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist with Goldman Sachs Research.  

“We're in the midst of a gradual rebuild of risk premium, and our view is that that process has room to go,” Karoui said on this week's episode of the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92d Exchanges podcast . 

Karoui notes that credit spreads, meaning the additional yield on corporate bonds as compared to Treasuries with similar maturities, have risen substantially in the past month. This is typically viewed as a sign that investors are becoming more concerned about the risk of defaults.  

“We've had a couple of quarters now where spreads were stuck at the very low end of the historical range,” Karoui says. “They should gradually go back to levels that are closer to historical medians, to reflect the new reality of elevated macro volatility and incrementally higher recession risk.” Still, he adds that recession risks have risen only “incrementally,” and that spreads are “still far away from getting close to recession levels.” 

Looking ahead, Karoui says spreads have room to widen somewhat further. But he says that since Treasury yields remain high compared with recent history, “you will get solid embedded protection from the yield component, and so your price return over at least a two- to three-month period is unlikely to dip into negative territory very much.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

India's domestic investors are spurring a boom in IPOs 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92e 
	

Last year, deal volumes in India's equity capital markets touched $71 billion — second only to the US. We spoke to Sudarshan Ramakrishnan and Dev Nambakam, co-heads of investment banking for Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets in India, about their   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92f outlook for Indian IPOs  in the near future.  

What's driving the surge in Indian IPOs? 

Sudarshan Ramakrishnan:  We're coming off the strongest year for Indian equity capital markets. We saw around $71 billion in deal volumes in equity capital markets in 2024, up from around $20 billion in 2022. I think there are three big factors behind this. One is that a lot of young companies are coming to market. All of them have created value in the private markets, and their profitability and growth suggest they're ready for the public markets.  

Second: A lot of these have been funded by financial investors in the private markets, across private equity and other capital funds. Now it's time for these funds to get liquidity in the public market. 

And third: A kind of perfect storm in terms of the deepening of the investor base in India.  

Could you give us a more detailed view of what has been happening with that investor base? 

Sudarshan Ramakrishnan:  In the last three years, domestic investors have invested around $130 billion in Indian companies. Domestic capital formation has created a market where issuers and investors of capital can really coexist — alongside foreign investors, who keep coming in and out of the market as well.  
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c930 
	

What is the mix of sectors involved in these IPOs? Is tech a dominant player? 

Dev Nambakam:  Three years ago, it was tech, tech, and tech. Off the back of Covid, tech companies did exceptionally well. Most traditional industries went the other way. Today, you have a huge number of tech and new-age companies listing in India, but the mix has become more balanced because you have traditional sectors such as financial services, industrials, consumer goods, and asset-heavy businesses like renewable energy or infrastructure.  

Do you expect this momentum to continue into 2025? 

Sudarshan Ramakrishnan:  Structurally, we feel very good about the long-term growth of India. The pipeline of companies waiting to go public is huge. Obviously you need markets to be supportive, and that is not dependent only on what is going on in India. I'd say over the next three-five years, we feel volumes will continue to grow. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

How can investors adapt to uncertain times? 	
	
	

	

For many investors, diverging fortunes of national economies, shifts in policy, and rapid technological change make for uncertain times. But they also present potential opportunities to adapt investment portfolios, as Goldman Sachs Asset Management explains in its   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c931 latest issue of Perspectives . 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c932 
	

Building resilience and return consistency into portfolios has become crucial, and steady income streams from public stock and bond markets provide a powerful form of diversification,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c933 writes Ashish Shah , co-head and chief investment officer of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Corporate bonds also offer attractive income potential, and the tight spreads to be found in the market today reflect healthy credit fundamentals. Shah also favors securitized credit: specifically collateralized loan obligations — a diverse pool of non-investment grade corporate loans, of which $1.4 trillion is outstanding globally — and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In equities, earnings and dividends are likely to become greater drivers of returns over the coming year. 

Actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have topped $1 trillion in assets under management since their debut in 2008, offer investors a flexible way to diversify. One recent source of growth has been options-based products such as derivative-income and buffer funds,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c934 write Brendan McCarthy , global head of ETF distribution for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and Marissa Ansell, head of global ETF investment strategy. These funds incorporate options into their investment strategies and can offer regular income or a measure of downside protection. For US-domiciled funds, the derivative-income category took in more than $28 billion of net new money in 2024. 

Hedge funds have outperformed traditional 60/40 portfolios on a one-, three-, and five-year absolute return basis, and even more so on a risk-adjusted basis: In the period from 2020-2024, 60/40 returns fell from 6.1% to 5.5%, while hedge fund returns increased from 4.8% to 9.3%. Against this backdrop, there has been a resurgence of investor demand. The hedge fund landscape has become more binary — between broader, platform hedge funds and specialized, smaller hedge funds (with decision making done quite differently for each). “Consequently, we believe allocators need to implement their hedge fund programs differently today, taking a clinical approach to strategy and manager selection, portfolio construction, and risk management,”  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c935 write Collin Bell , Elizabeth Burton, Jack Springate, and Funmi Awofisayo of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

One is that a lot of young companies are coming to market. All of them have created value in the private markets, and their profitability and growth suggest they're ready for the public markets.  

Second: A lot of these have been funded by financial investors in the private markets, across private equity and other capital funds. Now it's time for these funds to get liquidity in the public market. 

And third: A kind of perfect storm in terms of the deepening of the investor base in India.  

Could you give us a more detailed view of what has been happening with that investor base? 

Sudarshan Ramakrishnan:  In the last three years, domestic investors have invested around $130 billion in Indian companies. Domestic capital formation has created a market where issuers and investors of capital can really coexist — alongside foreign investors, who keep coming in and out of the market as well.

What is the mix of sectors involved in these IPOs? Is tech a dominant player? 

Dev Nambakam:  Three years ago, it was tech, tech, and tech. Off the back of Covid, tech companies did exceptionally well. Most traditional industries went the other way. Today, you have a huge number of tech and new-age companies listing in India, but the mix has become more balanced because you have traditional sectors such as financial services, industrials, consumer goods, and asset-heavy businesses like renewable energy or infrastructure.  

Do you expect this momentum to continue into 2025? 

Sudarshan Ramakrishnan:  Structurally, we feel very good about the long-term growth of India. The pipeline of companies waiting to go public is huge. Obviously you need markets to be supportive, and that is not dependent only on what is going on in India. I'd say over the next three-five years, we feel volumes will continue to grow. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

How can investors adapt to uncertain times? 	
	
	

	

For many investors, diverging fortunes of national economies, shifts in policy, and rapid technological change make for uncertain times. But they also present potential opportunities to adapt investment portfolios, as Goldman Sachs Asset Management explains in its   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c931 latest issue of Perspectives .

Building resilience and return consistency into portfolios has become crucial, and steady income streams from public stock and bond markets provide a powerful form of diversification,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c933 writes Ashish Shah , co-head and chief investment officer of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Corporate bonds also offer attractive income potential, and the tight spreads to be found in the market today reflect healthy credit fundamentals. Shah also favors securitized credit: specifically collateralized loan obligations — a diverse pool of non-investment grade corporate loans, of which $1.4 trillion is outstanding globally — and commercial mortgage-backed securities. In equities, earnings and dividends are likely to become greater drivers of returns over the coming year. 

Actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have topped $1 trillion in assets under management since their debut in 2008, offer investors a flexible way to diversify. One recent source of growth has been options-based products such as derivative-income and buffer funds,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c934 write Brendan McCarthy , global head of ETF distribution for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and Marissa Ansell, head of global ETF investment strategy. These funds incorporate options into their investment strategies and can offer regular income or a measure of downside protection. For US-domiciled funds, the derivative-income category took in more than $28 billion of net new money in 2024. 

Hedge funds have outperformed traditional 60/40 portfolios on a one-, three-, and five-year absolute return basis, and even more so on a risk-adjusted basis: In the period from 2020-2024, 60/40 returns fell from 6.1% to 5.5%, while hedge fund returns increased from 4.8% to 9.3%. Against this backdrop, there has been a resurgence of investor demand. The hedge fund landscape has become more binary — between broader, platform hedge funds and specialized, smaller hedge funds (with decision making done quite differently for each). “Consequently, we believe allocators need to implement their hedge fund programs differently today, taking a clinical approach to strategy and manager selection, portfolio construction, and risk management,”  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c935 write Collin Bell , Elizabeth Burton, Jack Springate, and Funmi Awofisayo of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

How global stock markets are projected to change 	
	
	

	

In the coming decades, US GDP may be surpassed by that of China and India, but US stock market capitalization is   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c921 still projected to lead the world , according to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c922 Goldman Sachs Research . 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c923 
	

Demographic projections and long-term drivers of productivity can help us glimpse how the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c924 global economy  may look 50 years in the future. By 2075, the US may be the only western country in the top five economies — a group that may be dominated by Asia and potentially include Nigeria, say Kevin Daly, co-head of Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa Economics in Global Macro Research, and economist Tadas Gedminas. 

China and India's populations of more than a billion inhabitants each matter a lot for GDP. China's population, for instance, is about four times larger than that of the US. For the country's GDP to be as large as the US's, GDP per person only needs to be about one-quarter that of the US GDP-per-person. “It's actually not that high a bar, because China's population is so much larger,” Daly says. 

But GDP is only one measure of economic heft. The US is forecast to remain twice as rich as China and India in 50 years. Real GDP per capita in other developed countries will also remain much higher than their emerging market counterparts in the coming decades.

Rich countries tend to have bigger stock markets: Goldman Sachs Research finds that there's a statistical link between ratios of equity market capitalisation-to-GDP and GDP-per-capita. While its share of global market cap will decline, the US equity market is projected in 2075 to still be some 60% larger than China's, the next-biggest.   
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

March QuickPoll: A big shift in sentiment 	
	
	

	

Investors are turning bearish on US growth even as they become more optimistic about European investment opportunities, according to the latest Marquee QuickPoll which surveyed 531 institutional clients from March 3 to 5. Key findings include:  

Rising risks.  Investor sentiment took a sharply bearish turn in March, reaching levels not seen since the onset of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle in 2022. Geopolitics and tariffs were cited as the biggest risks by 62% of investors surveyed. 

Sticky inflation . Investors increased their inflation expectations on the back of tariff developments, with about two-thirds of investors (up from 52% in January) expecting core US inflation to end the year above 2.5%. 

US pre-eminence fading?  While US recession worries have picked up, investors are growing more upbeat on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c926 European growth , and German defense spending in particular.

Goldman Sachs Research  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c929 raised its forecast  for the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92a euro zone's  real GDP growth this year to 0.8%, up from 0.7%, driven by a new fiscal plan in Germany and higher defense spending on the continent. Our economists increased their 2026 forecast for the currency area by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3%, and boosted the 2027 numbers by 0.3 percentage points to 1.6%. 

The fiscal plan from Europe's largest economy includes a €500 billion ($542 billion) off-budget infrastructure and climate protection fund and increased defense spending, which could boost economic activity across the region. Sven Jari Stehn, Goldman Sachs Research's chief European economist and his team increased their forecast for real GDP growth in Germany this year to 0.2% from flat. They also raised their 2026 forecast by 0.5 percentage points to 1.5% and the estimate for 2027 increased by 0.6 percentage points to 2%.

What credit markets are telling us 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92c 

Lotfi Karoui (L), Goldman Sachs Research's chief credit strategist, with Allison Nathan on Goldman Sachs Exchanges 
	
	
	

	

Bond markets are beginning to price in more economic risk, according to Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist with Goldman Sachs Research.  

“We're in the midst of a gradual rebuild of risk premium, and our view is that that process has room to go,” Karoui said on this week's episode of the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3515c7a7,977f4a09,6574c92d Exchanges podcast . 

Karoui notes that credit spreads, meaning the additional yield on corporate bonds as compared to Treasuries with similar maturities, have risen substantially in the past month. This is typically viewed as a sign that investors are becoming more concerned about the risk of defaults.  

“We've had a couple of quarters now where spreads were stuck at the very low end of the historical range,” Karoui says. “They should gradually go back to levels that are closer to historical medians, to reflect the new reality of elevated macro volatility and incrementally higher recession risk.” Still, he adds that recession risks have risen only “incrementally,” and that spreads are “still far away from getting close to recession levels.” 

Looking ahead, Karoui says spreads have room to widen somewhat further. But he says that since Treasury yields remain high compared with recent history, “you will get solid embedded protection from the yield component, and so your price return over at least a two- to three-month period is unlikely to dip into negative territory very much.”
