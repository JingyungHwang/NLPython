The impact of Trump's election on US equities 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9db 
	

	

The S&P 500 rose to a record this week after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Equity market volatility plunged as the election outcome became known faster than traders had expected, says Brian Garrett,  head of Equity Execution  on the Cross Asset Sales desk in Global Banking & Markets at Goldman Sachs .   

“I don't think many people had it in their playbook that we would know the next president by 11 am on Wednesday,” Garrett says on the latest episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9dc Goldman Sachs Exchanges . Previous US elections have taken days or longer to play out, and Garrett highlights that the two-day normalized decline in the CBOE Volatility Index (known as the VIX )  was one of its largest in the past decade.  

US stocks surged in part because many clients had reduced the amount of risk in their portfolio amid uncertainty about the results of the election, Garrett says.  Investors have since re-engaged some of the trades that were successful after the 2016 presidential race, such as  buying financials, small caps,  technology, and energy stocks, he says.     

While US stocks rallied, European equities declined the day after the US election, as clients began to focus on the potential ramifications of US tariffs on economic growth, says Christian Mueller-Glissmann,  head of  a sset  a llocation in  Goldman Sachs Research.  

Even though some potential Trump administration policies, such as tariffs, are seen as inflationary, commodities such as oil and copper declined.  T hat's likely in part because many commodities are priced in US dollars, and they tend to decline when the US currency gains, Mueller-Glissmann notes. Tariffs may also be a headwind for economic growth in China, one of the world's biggest consumers of commodities.

How US tariffs could filter through global stock markets 	
	
	

	

The prospect for trade tariffs is one of the main policy implications that investors are focused on following the election of Donald Trump as US president. His policy proposals include across-the-board tariffs on imports. 
European indices, along with China and other emerging markets, tend to be highly sensitive to trade restrictions, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our economists have also downgraded their forecasts for European GDP growth, reflecting the increase in trade uncertainty and the prospect for increased tariffs. By contrast, US stocks are typically less volatile relative to the broader stock market to changes in world trade. 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

In Europe, equity markets in Nordic countries and Germany tend to be the most vulnerable to tariffs. UK equities have defensive characteristics and the country's economy is services oriented, making it somewhat less sensitive to changes in trade. Goldman Sachs Research finds that Swiss stocks tend to be insulated to global trade because their products are technologically advanced and difficult to replace. 

Machinery and equipment, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals are the Europe products with the largest shares of exports to the US, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Stock market sectors like healthcare, which are considered defensive and have high margins, tend to be less prone to swings from trade uncertainty. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Americans are holding record shares of their assets in stocks 	
	
	

	

As the Federal Reserve cuts rates, investors may envision a rotation of assets out of money market mutual funds and into equities. But Goldman Sachs Research finds that money market funds typically continue to garner inflows even during cutting cycles, while flows into equity funds ultimately depend on the economic backdrop. 

US households held 48% of their financial assets in equities, as of October 15 — a record that equals the previous peak, set around the turn of the century. In contrast, despite strong money market inflows and record assets under management, allocations to cash represent around 15% of households' financial assets – near a record low, according to the Fed's Financial Accounts of the United States. 

Allocations to equities are far above the long-term median of 28%. “Household demand for equities has typically been strongest during periods of solid economic growth,” says David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research. “Although US real GDP growth averaged 2.9% in 2023 and 3.0% in the first half of 2024, the macro narrative has repeatedly shifted from recession fears to growth hopes.” 
	
	
	

	
  
	

US households directly own 38% of US equities, although this category includes other groups such as nonprofits. Indirectly, households may also own stocks through mutual funds, ETFs, and pension funds. Household allocation to debt was in line with the historical median of 16%. The remaining 21% of financial assets were divided among non-corporate equity, loans, and other miscellaneous assets. 

Through 2023 and over the first half of this year, households were net sellers of equities. Goldman Sachs Research expects that to change next year, though. “We expect households will be net buyers of $50 billion in US equities in 2025 as the economy remains strong and the Fed continues to cut,” says Kostin. Our analysts forecast corporate buybacks will be the largest source of equity demand in 2025. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Reaching net zero is forecast to require nearly $75 trillion of investment   	
	
	

	

Reducing net carbon emissions to zero by 2070 — and thus keeping global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — will require investment of nearly $75 trillion,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9de according to Goldman Sachs Research . The team recently updated its projections, as the path to keeping climate change to within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels appears increasingly out of reach. 

The total projected investment, representing $1.5-$2 trillion of infrastructure spending per year, spans a huge range of investment opportunities, writes Michele Della Vigna, head of Natural Resources Research in EMEA in Goldman Sachs Research. The forecasts include $7 trillion for power networks, another $5.1 trillion on energy storage, and $3.7 trillion for the infrastructure that will make the transition to electric vehicles possible. There's also $9.3 trillion needed to make industrial processes carbon neutral, and $1.3 trillion for green hydrogen plants. 
	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9df 
	

The team had previously projected that $62 trillion would be required to reach net zero and envisioned reaching that level by 2060. 

	- The scenario that achieves net zero emissions by 2070 and 2.0 degrees of warming would represent infrastructure investment equal to 1% to 1.5% of global GDP each year. It implies lower stranded costs for coal but an enormous increase, versus the 1.5-degree path, in costs to adapt to a warmer climate by 2050. 

	- The researchers now expect a longer life for hydrocarbon assets, with  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9e0 peak oil demand  occurring after 2030 and demand for natural gas as a transition fuel growing until 2050. “This implies new greenfield oil and gas developments are likely to be needed beyond 2040,” Della Vigna writes.

The future of AI may hinge on geopolitics 	
	
	

	

The US and China are the two leaders in artificial intelligence, but the industry is global, and so is the infrastructure that makes AI possible. Building the global data centers, energy grids, and networks to sustain AI is a geopolitical test that companies and countries alike will need to pass, Jared Cohen, co-head of the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9e2 Goldman Sachs Global Institute , writes in the magazine  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9e3 Foreign Policy . 

Competition over AI has so far been dominated by debates about leading-edge semiconductors. But the next phase is also about geography and power. Where can the data centers that power AI workloads be built? And who has the capital, energy, and infrastructure needed? “The countries that work with companies to host data centers running AI workloads can gain economic, political, and technological advantages and leverage,” Cohen writes. “But data centers also present national security sensitivities, given that they often house high-end, export-controlled semiconductors and governments, businesses, and everyday users send some of their most sensitive information through them.” 

The US leads the world in data centers. But while reforms and innovation can improve the domestic outlook, the energy demands of data centers may accelerate far more quickly than the capacities of America's power grid. “America cannot achieve AI autarky, especially when it comes to data centers,” Cohen writes, adding that the US will need close partners for a secure global data center buildout. Data center diplomacy will require detailed risk assessment over issues like export controls, data security and privacy, and geopolitical alignments. 

Cohen identifies Canada and the Nordic countries as key data center hubs, and Japan and South Korea as important technology partners. Energy-rich countries in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, with significant digital connectivity and the kind of flexible, longterm capital required for data center investments, are also key players. For these countries and others, Cohen writes, “the data center buildout provides an opportunity…to lead in aspects of what could power the next global industrial revolution.”

The S&P 500 rose to a record this week after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Equity market volatility plunged as the election outcome became known faster than traders had expected, says Brian Garrett,  head of Equity Execution  on the Cross Asset Sales desk in Global Banking & Markets at Goldman Sachs .

As the Federal Reserve cuts rates, investors may envision a rotation of assets out of money market mutual funds and into equities. But Goldman Sachs Research finds that money market funds typically continue to garner inflows even during cutting cycles, while flows into equity funds ultimately depend on the economic backdrop. 

US households held 48% of their financial assets in equities, as of October 15 — a record that equals the previous peak, set around the turn of the century. In contrast, despite strong money market inflows and record assets under management, allocations to cash represent around 15% of households' financial assets – near a record low, according to the Fed's Financial Accounts of the United States. 

Allocations to equities are far above the long-term median of 28%. “Household demand for equities has typically been strongest during periods of solid economic growth,” says David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research. “Although US real GDP growth averaged 2.9% in 2023 and 3.0% in the first half of 2024, the macro narrative has repeatedly shifted from recession fears to growth hopes.”

Through 2023 and over the first half of this year, households were net sellers of equities. Goldman Sachs Research expects that to change next year, though. “We expect households will be net buyers of $50 billion in US equities in 2025 as the economy remains strong and the Fed continues to cut,” says Kostin. Our analysts forecast corporate buybacks will be the largest source of equity demand in 2025. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Reaching net zero is forecast to require nearly $75 trillion of investment   	
	
	

	

Reducing net carbon emissions to zero by 2070 — and thus keeping global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — will require investment of nearly $75 trillion,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9de according to Goldman Sachs Research .

The impact of Trump's election on US equities 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9db 
	

	

The S&P 500 rose to a record this week after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Equity market volatility plunged as the election outcome became known faster than traders had expected, says Brian Garrett,  head of Equity Execution  on the Cross Asset Sales desk in Global Banking & Markets at Goldman Sachs .   

“I don't think many people had it in their playbook that we would know the next president by 11 am on Wednesday,” Garrett says on the latest episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9dc Goldman Sachs Exchanges . Previous US elections have taken days or longer to play out, and Garrett highlights that the two-day normalized decline in the CBOE Volatility Index (known as the VIX )  was one of its largest in the past decade.  

US stocks surged in part because many clients had reduced the amount of risk in their portfolio amid uncertainty about the results of the election, Garrett says.  Investors have since re-engaged some of the trades that were successful after the 2016 presidential race, such as  buying financials, small caps,  technology, and energy stocks, he says.     

While US stocks rallied, European equities declined the day after the US election, as clients began to focus on the potential ramifications of US tariffs on economic growth, says Christian Mueller-Glissmann,  head of  a sset  a llocation in  Goldman Sachs Research.  

Even though some potential Trump administration policies, such as tariffs, are seen as inflationary, commodities such as oil and copper declined.  T hat's likely in part because many commodities are priced in US dollars, and they tend to decline when the US currency gains, Mueller-Glissmann notes. Tariffs may also be a headwind for economic growth in China, one of the world's biggest consumers of commodities.

How US tariffs could filter through global stock markets 	
	
	

	

The prospect for trade tariffs is one of the main policy implications that investors are focused on following the election of Donald Trump as US president. His policy proposals include across-the-board tariffs on imports. 
European indices, along with China and other emerging markets, tend to be highly sensitive to trade restrictions, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our economists have also downgraded their forecasts for European GDP growth, reflecting the increase in trade uncertainty and the prospect for increased tariffs. By contrast, US stocks are typically less volatile relative to the broader stock market to changes in world trade. 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

In Europe, equity markets in Nordic countries and Germany tend to be the most vulnerable to tariffs. UK equities have defensive characteristics and the country's economy is services oriented, making it somewhat less sensitive to changes in trade. Goldman Sachs Research finds that Swiss stocks tend to be insulated to global trade because their products are technologically advanced and difficult to replace. 

Machinery and equipment, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals are the Europe products with the largest shares of exports to the US, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Stock market sectors like healthcare, which are considered defensive and have high margins, tend to be less prone to swings from trade uncertainty. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Americans are holding record shares of their assets in stocks 	
	
	

	

As the Federal Reserve cuts rates, investors may envision a rotation of assets out of money market mutual funds and into equities. But Goldman Sachs Research finds that money market funds typically continue to garner inflows even during cutting cycles, while flows into equity funds ultimately depend on the economic backdrop. 

US households held 48% of their financial assets in equities, as of October 15 — a record that equals the previous peak, set around the turn of the century. In contrast, despite strong money market inflows and record assets under management, allocations to cash represent around 15% of households' financial assets – near a record low, according to the Fed's Financial Accounts of the United States. 

Allocations to equities are far above the long-term median of 28%. “Household demand for equities has typically been strongest during periods of solid economic growth,” says David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research. “Although US real GDP growth averaged 2.9% in 2023 and 3.0% in the first half of 2024, the macro narrative has repeatedly shifted from recession fears to growth hopes.” 
	
	
	

	
  
	

US households directly own 38% of US equities, although this category includes other groups such as nonprofits. Indirectly, households may also own stocks through mutual funds, ETFs, and pension funds. Household allocation to debt was in line with the historical median of 16%. The remaining 21% of financial assets were divided among non-corporate equity, loans, and other miscellaneous assets. 

Through 2023 and over the first half of this year, households were net sellers of equities. Goldman Sachs Research expects that to change next year, though. “We expect households will be net buyers of $50 billion in US equities in 2025 as the economy remains strong and the Fed continues to cut,” says Kostin. Our analysts forecast corporate buybacks will be the largest source of equity demand in 2025. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Reaching net zero is forecast to require nearly $75 trillion of investment   	
	
	

	

Reducing net carbon emissions to zero by 2070 — and thus keeping global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — will require investment of nearly $75 trillion,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9de according to Goldman Sachs Research . The team recently updated its projections, as the path to keeping climate change to within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels appears increasingly out of reach. 

The total projected investment, representing $1.5-$2 trillion of infrastructure spending per year, spans a huge range of investment opportunities, writes Michele Della Vigna, head of Natural Resources Research in EMEA in Goldman Sachs Research. The forecasts include $7 trillion for power networks, another $5.1 trillion on energy storage, and $3.7 trillion for the infrastructure that will make the transition to electric vehicles possible. There's also $9.3 trillion needed to make industrial processes carbon neutral, and $1.3 trillion for green hydrogen plants. 
	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9df 
	

The team had previously projected that $62 trillion would be required to reach net zero and envisioned reaching that level by 2060. 

	- The scenario that achieves net zero emissions by 2070 and 2.0 degrees of warming would represent infrastructure investment equal to 1% to 1.5% of global GDP each year. It implies lower stranded costs for coal but an enormous increase, versus the 1.5-degree path, in costs to adapt to a warmer climate by 2050. 

	- The researchers now expect a longer life for hydrocarbon assets, with  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9e0 peak oil demand  occurring after 2030 and demand for natural gas as a transition fuel growing until 2050. “This implies new greenfield oil and gas developments are likely to be needed beyond 2040,” Della Vigna writes.

The future of AI may hinge on geopolitics 	
	
	

	

The US and China are the two leaders in artificial intelligence, but the industry is global, and so is the infrastructure that makes AI possible. Building the global data centers, energy grids, and networks to sustain AI is a geopolitical test that companies and countries alike will need to pass, Jared Cohen, co-head of the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9e2 Goldman Sachs Global Institute , writes in the magazine  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t30dd2e2b,91ffe54a,6570c9e3 Foreign Policy . 

Competition over AI has so far been dominated by debates about leading-edge semiconductors. But the next phase is also about geography and power. Where can the data centers that power AI workloads be built? And who has the capital, energy, and infrastructure needed? “The countries that work with companies to host data centers running AI workloads can gain economic, political, and technological advantages and leverage,” Cohen writes. “But data centers also present national security sensitivities, given that they often house high-end, export-controlled semiconductors and governments, businesses, and everyday users send some of their most sensitive information through them.” 

The US leads the world in data centers. But while reforms and innovation can improve the domestic outlook, the energy demands of data centers may accelerate far more quickly than the capacities of America's power grid. “America cannot achieve AI autarky, especially when it comes to data centers,” Cohen writes, adding that the US will need close partners for a secure global data center buildout. Data center diplomacy will require detailed risk assessment over issues like export controls, data security and privacy, and geopolitical alignments. 

Cohen identifies Canada and the Nordic countries as key data center hubs, and Japan and South Korea as important technology partners. Energy-rich countries in the Middle East like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, with significant digital connectivity and the kind of flexible, longterm capital required for data center investments, are also key players. For these countries and others, Cohen writes, “the data center buildout provides an opportunity…to lead in aspects of what could power the next global industrial revolution.”
