Why the US equity bull market could keep running 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c709 
	

Even as rising interest rates put pressure on equities, there are still reasons to be excited about US stocks,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70a according to Mike Washington , equities sales trader with Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. 

“There has been a material move higher in yields,” Washington says. “When rates rise at this velocity, equities have tended to underperform over the next month.” 

But he adds that “there's a lot in the market's favor in 2025.” 

Washington says the rise of AI could start to benefit a wide range of companies. He also notes that companies could be a powerful source of demand for equities. Corporate repurchase authorizations rose to nearly a record high in 2024, which means companies have the green light to buy back a significant amount of their own shares this year.

Finally, he says that while investor sentiment may have been "stretched" in December, it "has really come off the highs." 
"I think, all said and done," Washington concludes, "we're looking at another double-digit-return year." 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

The Key Number: 60 basis points 	
	
	

	

US stocks are usually able to withstand an increase in bond yields — as long as it's gradual, says Ryan Hammond in Goldman Sachs Research's US portfolio strategy team. But when 10-year Treasury yields rise by two standard deviations in a month — right now, that would be around 60 basis points — equities tend to fall. 
	
	
	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70c 
	

Ten-year Treasury yields have risen about 40 basis points over the past month (as of January 14). They are up as much as 50 basis points relative to their trough in early December. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

UK gilt yields are forecast to decline in 2025 despite recent surge 	
	
	

	

UK government bond yields have risen amid investor concern about the government's fiscal outlook and sticky inflation. Even so,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70d Goldman Sachs Research projects  the country's borrowing costs will gradually decline by the end of the year as the Bank of England cuts its policy rate. 

	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70e 
	

“We still think that the UK data will justify more cuts than the market is pricing,” says George Cole, head of European rates strategy in Goldman Sachs Research. Our strategists project 100 basis points of cuts in 2025, compared to the 41 basis points of cuts priced into the bond market. The team forecasts 10-year gilt yields will fall to about 4% by the end of 2025 from 4.9% as of January 13, the highest since 2008. 
In case you missed it:    https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70f Our economists revised  their forecast for US Federal Reserve rate cuts to two in 2025 and one in 2026. They previously projected three cuts this year. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Will energy stocks outperform in 2025? 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

Growing demand for power should help energy stocks outperform in 2025, according to the majority of respondents in a survey at Goldman Sachs' 2025 Energy, Cleantech, and Utilities Conference. 

Almost three-quarters of respondents thought the theme of power demand would enjoy continued momentum this year, compared to just 2% who thought that the theme had already played out when it comes to share performance. 

Likewise, nearly three-quarters of respondents expected traditional energy stocks to perform in line with the S&P 500 index or even better this year. On the other hand, more than half thought that clean energy stocks specifically would underperform the S&P 500. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

Among clean tech segments, respondents were most bullish about energy storage, with 48% predicting that the technology would outperform other segments this year. The US was seen as the most promising region for clean tech performance by 65% of respondents, with China trailing at 24%. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

January QuickPoll: Bullishness fades, caution on inflation rises 	
	
	

	

Investors are turning more bearish amid rising concerns about inflation and expectations of fewer rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve, according to the latest Marquee QuickPoll, which surveyed nearly 680 institutional investors in early January. (The poll closed on January 8). Key highlights include: 

	
	
	

	- More than half of respondents expect the Fed funds rate to be 3.75% or higher at the end of 2025. This implies about 50 basis points of cuts for the year. (Goldman Sachs Research forecasts two cuts this year with a terminal rate of 3.5% to 3.75%.) Views on inflation were split, with about half of survey respondents expecting core inflation to end the year above 2.5%. 

	
	
	

	
  
	

	- The percentage of investors describing themselves as bullish or slightly bullish declined to 42% in January, from 60% in early December and 67% in November. “This could be partly attributed to the change in tone at the December FOMC, with less easing expected and more caution around inflation,” says Oscar Ostlund, Goldman Sachs' global head of content strategy, market analytics, and data science. “But on aggregate, investors are still bullish on risk assets.” 

	- In line with prior months, investors say their favorite investment is to hold developed market equities, with developed market bonds and gold coming in as their second-favorite investments. 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Will China's policy stimulus be enough? 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c710 
	

As China faces heightened trade risks following the US election, the country is also grappling with domestic economic challenges — owing largely to a years-long property crisis and weak domestic demand. Policymakers have announced a raft of stimulus measures in recent months. But will they be enough?  

The recently approved RMB 10 trillion local government debt swap plan is the most important easing measure announced so far in terms of addressing the most urgent economic risk today, says Hui Shan, Goldman Sachs Research's chief China economist, in a discussion with  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c711 Goldman Sachs Exchanges  host Allison Nathan. 

That's because it creates crucial fiscal breathing room for local governments to continue providing services vital for their citizens' wellbeing. “We think that this [plan] is important and underappreciated,” says Shan, noting that without it, local economies across the country would face enormous pressure in the coming years. 

The more crucial question, though, is whether policymakers will be successful in boosting consumption — an important component of domestic demand — which Shan and Michael Pettis, of Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, believe will be critical for China's economic trajectory as it seeks a new engine of sustainable growth. 

But Pettis isn't very confident, arguing that Chinese policymakers have yet to confront the fundamental problem — which is that China needs more consumption relative to production, not just more consumption. “It's got a huge imbalance,” he says. “The idea that the good way to drive up consumption is by driving up production and having part of that flow into consumption gets it completely backwards,” he says, noting that attempting to increase consumption by continuing to subsidize the supply side of the economy will only worsen the current imbalance in the economy.

Why the US equity bull market could keep running 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c709 
	

Even as rising interest rates put pressure on equities, there are still reasons to be excited about US stocks,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70a according to Mike Washington , equities sales trader with Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. 

“There has been a material move higher in yields,” Washington says. “When rates rise at this velocity, equities have tended to underperform over the next month.” 

But he adds that “there's a lot in the market's favor in 2025.” 

Washington says the rise of AI could start to benefit a wide range of companies. He also notes that companies could be a powerful source of demand for equities. Corporate repurchase authorizations rose to nearly a record high in 2024, which means companies have the green light to buy back a significant amount of their own shares this year. 
	
	
	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70b 

Finally, he says that while investor sentiment may have been "stretched" in December, it "has really come off the highs." 
"I think, all said and done," Washington concludes, "we're looking at another double-digit-return year." 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

The Key Number: 60 basis points 	
	
	

	

US stocks are usually able to withstand an increase in bond yields — as long as it's gradual, says Ryan Hammond in Goldman Sachs Research's US portfolio strategy team. But when 10-year Treasury yields rise by two standard deviations in a month — right now, that would be around 60 basis points — equities tend to fall. 
	
	
	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70c 
	

Ten-year Treasury yields have risen about 40 basis points over the past month (as of January 14). They are up as much as 50 basis points relative to their trough in early December. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

UK gilt yields are forecast to decline in 2025 despite recent surge 	
	
	

	

UK government bond yields have risen amid investor concern about the government's fiscal outlook and sticky inflation. Even so,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70d Goldman Sachs Research projects  the country's borrowing costs will gradually decline by the end of the year as the Bank of England cuts its policy rate. 

	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70e 
	

“We still think that the UK data will justify more cuts than the market is pricing,” says George Cole, head of European rates strategy in Goldman Sachs Research. Our strategists project 100 basis points of cuts in 2025, compared to the 41 basis points of cuts priced into the bond market. The team forecasts 10-year gilt yields will fall to about 4% by the end of 2025 from 4.9% as of January 13, the highest since 2008. 
In case you missed it:    https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c70f Our economists revised  their forecast for US Federal Reserve rate cuts to two in 2025 and one in 2026. They previously projected three cuts this year. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Will energy stocks outperform in 2025? 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

Growing demand for power should help energy stocks outperform in 2025, according to the majority of respondents in a survey at Goldman Sachs' 2025 Energy, Cleantech, and Utilities Conference. 

Almost three-quarters of respondents thought the theme of power demand would enjoy continued momentum this year, compared to just 2% who thought that the theme had already played out when it comes to share performance. 

Likewise, nearly three-quarters of respondents expected traditional energy stocks to perform in line with the S&P 500 index or even better this year. On the other hand, more than half thought that clean energy stocks specifically would underperform the S&P 500. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

Among clean tech segments, respondents were most bullish about energy storage, with 48% predicting that the technology would outperform other segments this year. The US was seen as the most promising region for clean tech performance by 65% of respondents, with China trailing at 24%. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

January QuickPoll: Bullishness fades, caution on inflation rises 	
	
	

	

Investors are turning more bearish amid rising concerns about inflation and expectations of fewer rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve, according to the latest Marquee QuickPoll, which surveyed nearly 680 institutional investors in early January. (The poll closed on January 8). Key highlights include: 

	
	
	

	- More than half of respondents expect the Fed funds rate to be 3.75% or higher at the end of 2025. This implies about 50 basis points of cuts for the year. (Goldman Sachs Research forecasts two cuts this year with a terminal rate of 3.5% to 3.75%.) Views on inflation were split, with about half of survey respondents expecting core inflation to end the year above 2.5%. 

	
	
	

	
  
	

	- The percentage of investors describing themselves as bullish or slightly bullish declined to 42% in January, from 60% in early December and 67% in November. “This could be partly attributed to the change in tone at the December FOMC, with less easing expected and more caution around inflation,” says Oscar Ostlund, Goldman Sachs' global head of content strategy, market analytics, and data science. “But on aggregate, investors are still bullish on risk assets.” 

	- In line with prior months, investors say their favorite investment is to hold developed market equities, with developed market bonds and gold coming in as their second-favorite investments. 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Will China's policy stimulus be enough? 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c710 
	

As China faces heightened trade risks following the US election, the country is also grappling with domestic economic challenges — owing largely to a years-long property crisis and weak domestic demand. Policymakers have announced a raft of stimulus measures in recent months. But will they be enough?  

The recently approved RMB 10 trillion local government debt swap plan is the most important easing measure announced so far in terms of addressing the most urgent economic risk today, says Hui Shan, Goldman Sachs Research's chief China economist, in a discussion with  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t336e9161,952374e7,6572c711 Goldman Sachs Exchanges  host Allison Nathan. 

That's because it creates crucial fiscal breathing room for local governments to continue providing services vital for their citizens' wellbeing. “We think that this [plan] is important and underappreciated,” says Shan, noting that without it, local economies across the country would face enormous pressure in the coming years. 

The more crucial question, though, is whether policymakers will be successful in boosting consumption — an important component of domestic demand — which Shan and Michael Pettis, of Peking University's Guanghua School of Management, believe will be critical for China's economic trajectory as it seeks a new engine of sustainable growth. 

But Pettis isn't very confident, arguing that Chinese policymakers have yet to confront the fundamental problem — which is that China needs more consumption relative to production, not just more consumption. “It's got a huge imbalance,” he says. “The idea that the good way to drive up consumption is by driving up production and having part of that flow into consumption gets it completely backwards,” he says, noting that attempting to increase consumption by continuing to subsidize the supply side of the economy will only worsen the current imbalance in the economy.
