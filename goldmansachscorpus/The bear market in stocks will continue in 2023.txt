The outlook is mixed for 2023 	
	
	

	

With 2022 drawing to a close, we are   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ea pulling together outlooks for the year ahead — they cover expectations for economic growth, equities, unemployment, interest rates and more.  Take a look at some of the key insights we have published: 

	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04eb The U.S. will probably stick a soft landing next year . T he world's largest economy is forecast to narrowly avoid a recession as inflation fades and unemployment nudges up slightly, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ec economists say there's a 35% probability that the U.S. will tip into recession  over the next year, an estimate that's well below the median of 65% among forecasters in a Wall Street Journal survey.

	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ee The bear market in global stock markets is forecast to intensify  before giving way to more hopeful signals later in the year, according to Goldman Sachs Research. While valuations have declined, they started from a very high peak amid ultra-low interest rates. And though many equity markets around the globe are trading at low valuations, U.S. stocks aren't — American equity valuations are still at levels consistent with the peak of the technology bubble in the late 1990s. 
	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ef U.S. stocks are expected to have less pain but no gain in 2023 . The S&P 500 Index is forecast to turn out flat returns and no growth in earnings in 2023 after declining about 17% this year, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our strategists expect the benchmark to fall about 9% in the next three months before rebounding after the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle ends in May. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Central bank tightening: what could break?  	
	
	

	

Central banks' aggressive policy tightening  has raised concerns about what could break in a global financial system accustomed to low rates. In the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f0 latest episode of Exchanges at Goldman Sachs , host Allison Nathan  speaks with Jeremy Stein , professor at Harvard University and former Federal Reserve Board Governor, and Vítor Constâncio , former vice president of the European Central Bank, about the challenge of balancing financial stability risks in implementing monetary policy. 

Fighting inflation should be the Fed's top priority , Stein says, although he warns that financial stability risks should not be discounted. “Inflation is a very serious problem,” he says. “So given where it is now and the very real risk of it getting embedded into expectations and becoming something of a self-fulfilling problem, I think the Fed's only option for now is to continue to make inflation the number one policy priority. I don't think you can preemptively pull back on fighting inflation because of the risk of an unknown possible financial breakage that hasn't yet manifested.” 

Constâncio, for his part, argues that monetary policy should not respond to financial stability , even as the ECB now formally includes financial stability considerations in its policy decisions. “Interest rates cannot be used to serve several different objectives like the economy, inflation and then also financial stability,” he says. But given that both the Fed and ECB are already approaching the expected peak in policy rates, he expects the current hiking cycle to end before significant risks arise. “I think that the central banks will stop hiking rates before the tensions with financial stability come to an extreme situation where monetary policy could have to really consider that other objective.” 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Efforts to fortify supply chains could be inflationary 	
	
	

	

Covid-related supply chain disruptions and the inflation they brought about in the U.S. are starting to ease , but some of the reaction to that disruption — in the form of new trade policies and reshoring efforts —   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f1 could cause inflationary pressures of their own, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Research . 	
	
	

	

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f2 	
	
	

	

Semiconductors is one industry to watch, given the recent focus on reshoring chip production. Sourcing semiconductors in the U.S. raises costs, and inflationary pressures could strengthen if domestic chip production can't ramp up quickly enough to offset declines in imports,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f3 according to the report. 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Holiday shoppers set to rein in spending 	
	
	

	

Inflationary pressures continue to weigh on consumer wallets in the U.S ., with 46% of people saying they plan to spend less this holiday season, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research.  Other highlights from the survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers include: 

	- Focus on value . There is increasing evidence that consumers are feeling the weight of inflation and trimming spending on gifts they perceive as more expensive, despite higher levels of promotions observed in the market. Nearly 80% of survey respondents expect to adjust their behavior as a result of higher prices. 
	- Trading down . Roughly 55% of respondents plan to buy fewer items this year, with some also planning to trade down to cheaper price points and quality levels. 
	- Shifting back to brick-and-mortar stores . While e-commerce trends have remained sticky post-pandemic, only 40% of respondents indicated plans to spend more online this year — the lowest rate of increase Goldman Sachs Research has seen in recent surveys (43% in 2021 and 48% in 2020). In contrast, 29% of consumers plan to spend less online, and 31% plan to spend the same.

Female entrepreneurs and investors are still fighting an uphill battle, according to  CNBC 's senior media and tech correspondent  Julia Boorstin  and  Sallie Krawcheck , the CEO and co-founder of  Ellevest , a digital investment platform tailored to women investors. In a recent episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f5   Talks at GS , they outlined problems across the investing landscape: 

	- “In a patriarchal society, when we say it's for everybody, it's typically for men, right?" Krawcheck says. Our society and the investing landscape is still heavily set up to benefit men and not women, she explains.  
	- Female CEOs represent about 8.5% of the Fortune 500, and only 2% of venture capital funding went towards female founders last year, according to Boorstin.  
	- The odds are also stacked against women in fintech, Krawcheck says: “We [found that] women raise one in every $10,000 Series B [the second round of funding for start-ups] fintech dollars.”   

	
	
	

	

But change could be ahead.  Krawcheck, who is profiled in Boorstin's new book, When Women Lead , is one example of an entrepreneur who wants to build a company centered around women. “What if we get together a group of women and we build something for ourselves?” she asks.  

And female leadership has its own benefits. “There is also a ton of data about how female-led companies outperform,” Boorstin says. “There's some data in my book about how, after a female CEO is appointed to a public company, in the following two years, her stock typically outperforms by 20%. The numbers do not lie.”

	- “There is a ton of data about how female-led companies outperform." Here's   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04e8 why the future could be bright  for female entrepreneurs and investors.

The outlook is mixed for 2023 	
	
	

	

With 2022 drawing to a close, we are   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ea pulling together outlooks for the year ahead — they cover expectations for economic growth, equities, unemployment, interest rates and more.  Take a look at some of the key insights we have published: 

	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04eb The U.S. will probably stick a soft landing next year . T he world's largest economy is forecast to narrowly avoid a recession as inflation fades and unemployment nudges up slightly, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ec economists say there's a 35% probability that the U.S. will tip into recession  over the next year, an estimate that's well below the median of 65% among forecasters in a Wall Street Journal survey. 
	
	
	

	

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ed 	
	
	

	

	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ee The bear market in global stock markets is forecast to intensify  before giving way to more hopeful signals later in the year, according to Goldman Sachs Research. While valuations have declined, they started from a very high peak amid ultra-low interest rates. And though many equity markets around the globe are trading at low valuations, U.S. stocks aren't — American equity valuations are still at levels consistent with the peak of the technology bubble in the late 1990s. 
	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04ef U.S. stocks are expected to have less pain but no gain in 2023 . The S&P 500 Index is forecast to turn out flat returns and no growth in earnings in 2023 after declining about 17% this year, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our strategists expect the benchmark to fall about 9% in the next three months before rebounding after the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle ends in May. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Central bank tightening: what could break?  	
	
	

	

Central banks' aggressive policy tightening  has raised concerns about what could break in a global financial system accustomed to low rates. In the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f0 latest episode of Exchanges at Goldman Sachs , host Allison Nathan  speaks with Jeremy Stein , professor at Harvard University and former Federal Reserve Board Governor, and Vítor Constâncio , former vice president of the European Central Bank, about the challenge of balancing financial stability risks in implementing monetary policy. 

Fighting inflation should be the Fed's top priority , Stein says, although he warns that financial stability risks should not be discounted. “Inflation is a very serious problem,” he says. “So given where it is now and the very real risk of it getting embedded into expectations and becoming something of a self-fulfilling problem, I think the Fed's only option for now is to continue to make inflation the number one policy priority. I don't think you can preemptively pull back on fighting inflation because of the risk of an unknown possible financial breakage that hasn't yet manifested.” 

Constâncio, for his part, argues that monetary policy should not respond to financial stability , even as the ECB now formally includes financial stability considerations in its policy decisions. “Interest rates cannot be used to serve several different objectives like the economy, inflation and then also financial stability,” he says. But given that both the Fed and ECB are already approaching the expected peak in policy rates, he expects the current hiking cycle to end before significant risks arise. “I think that the central banks will stop hiking rates before the tensions with financial stability come to an extreme situation where monetary policy could have to really consider that other objective.” 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Efforts to fortify supply chains could be inflationary 	
	
	

	

Covid-related supply chain disruptions and the inflation they brought about in the U.S. are starting to ease , but some of the reaction to that disruption — in the form of new trade policies and reshoring efforts —   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f1 could cause inflationary pressures of their own, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Research . 	
	
	

	

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f2 	
	
	

	

Semiconductors is one industry to watch, given the recent focus on reshoring chip production. Sourcing semiconductors in the U.S. raises costs, and inflationary pressures could strengthen if domestic chip production can't ramp up quickly enough to offset declines in imports,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f3 according to the report. 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Holiday shoppers set to rein in spending 	
	
	

	

Inflationary pressures continue to weigh on consumer wallets in the U.S ., with 46% of people saying they plan to spend less this holiday season, according to a recent Goldman Sachs Research.  Other highlights from the survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers include: 

	- Focus on value . There is increasing evidence that consumers are feeling the weight of inflation and trimming spending on gifts they perceive as more expensive, despite higher levels of promotions observed in the market. Nearly 80% of survey respondents expect to adjust their behavior as a result of higher prices. 
	- Trading down . Roughly 55% of respondents plan to buy fewer items this year, with some also planning to trade down to cheaper price points and quality levels. 
	- Shifting back to brick-and-mortar stores . While e-commerce trends have remained sticky post-pandemic, only 40% of respondents indicated plans to spend more online this year — the lowest rate of increase Goldman Sachs Research has seen in recent surveys (43% in 2021 and 48% in 2020). In contrast, 29% of consumers plan to spend less online, and 31% plan to spend the same. 
	
	
	

  	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

When will the tide turn for female entrepreneurs?

Female entrepreneurs and investors are still fighting an uphill battle, according to  CNBC 's senior media and tech correspondent  Julia Boorstin  and  Sallie Krawcheck , the CEO and co-founder of  Ellevest , a digital investment platform tailored to women investors. In a recent episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f5   Talks at GS , they outlined problems across the investing landscape: 

	- “In a patriarchal society, when we say it's for everybody, it's typically for men, right?" Krawcheck says. Our society and the investing landscape is still heavily set up to benefit men and not women, she explains.  
	- Female CEOs represent about 8.5% of the Fortune 500, and only 2% of venture capital funding went towards female founders last year, according to Boorstin.  
	- The odds are also stacked against women in fintech, Krawcheck says: “We [found that] women raise one in every $10,000 Series B [the second round of funding for start-ups] fintech dollars.”   

	
	
	

	

But change could be ahead.  Krawcheck, who is profiled in Boorstin's new book, When Women Lead , is one example of an entrepreneur who wants to build a company centered around women. “What if we get together a group of women and we build something for ourselves?” she asks.  

And female leadership has its own benefits. “There is also a ton of data about how female-led companies outperform,” Boorstin says. “There's some data in my book about how, after a female CEO is appointed to a public company, in the following two years, her stock typically outperforms by 20%. The numbers do not lie.” 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	
	
	

	

Are you an aspiring entrepreneur? Learn from some of the best 	
	
	

	

We spoke with exceptional entrepreneurs at our   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f6 Builders and Innovators Summit  about what they've learned   from their business journeys. Here are three entrepreneurs who shared some of the most important lessons they've learned over the years.  	
	
	

	

	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f7 Leading teams in uncertain times : “The most challenging thing for me has been just how much people have going on in their lives. People are taking care of loved ones. People are dealing with inflation. They're worried about their finances. To have a team so worried about so many different things, I think, is a totally novel problem.” - Isabelle Kenyon , founder and CEO, Calibrate. 

	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f8 Advice to ignore : “When I first started the company, people thought that my vision was too big and that I should focus and narrow in on solving one specific problem for our demographic. And actually, the fact that we solve multiple problems for the same audience is our strength.” - Morgan DeBaun , founder and CEO, Blavity Inc. 

	-  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1e0ef63b,6d9c0ff3,655c04f9 Managing growth : “I think a lot about how to retain a long-term mindset in a time where everyone wants to think very short term. You get a lot of pressure from people. And I've really wanted to fight that.” April Koh , co-founder and CEO, Spring Health.
