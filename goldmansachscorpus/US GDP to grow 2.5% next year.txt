US GDP is forecast to outperform expectations in 2025 	
	
	

	

The world's largest economy is forecast to outperform economist expectations again next year,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713592 according to Goldman Sachs Research . US GDP is expected to grow 2.5% on a full-year basis, compared with 1.9% for the consensus forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

“Recession fears have diminished, inflation is trending back toward 2%, and the labor market has rebalanced but remains strong,” David Mericle, chief US economist in Goldman Sachs Research, writes in the team's report, which is titled “2025 US Economic Outlook: New Policies, Similar Path." 

Three key policy changes following the Republican sweep in Washington are predicted to affect the economy:   

	- Tariff increases on imports from China and on autos may raise the effective tariff rate by 3 to 4 percentage points. 

	- Tighter policy may lower net immigration to 750,000 per year, moderately below the pre-pandemic average of 1 million per year.    

	- The 2017 tax cuts are expected to be fully extended instead of expiring and there will be modest additional tax cuts.   

While the expected policy changes are significant, Mericle doesn't anticipate that they will substantially alter the trajectory of the economy or monetary policy. Goldman Sachs Research forecasts the Federal Reserve will continue to cut the funds rate down to a terminal rate of 3.25-3.5% (the policy rate is 4.5% to 4.75% now).

"We still think you've got some upside to equities. You've got some upside to the dollar. You've got some outperformance of non-US bonds and European bond yields falling relative to the US." 

— Dominic Wilson, senior advisor in Global Markets Research, on the team's forecasts for the year ahead

Investing in sports: The next trillion-dollar market? 	
	
	

	

The sports ecosystem has exploded as an area of investment, with professional leagues loosening rules on private equity ownership, the value of media rights deals skyrocketing, and the many sports-adjacent businesses taking on new dimensions.   
    
Sports is a unique investment because of its addressable market, which is estimated to be just shy of 8 billion people, Elis Jones, Goldman Sachs' Head of Sports Investment Banking for EMEA, says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713597 the first episode of   Investing in Sports , a four-part series from the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast. “It's a hugely important pillar of society. And that was most evident through Covid, not only in the absence of being able to watch, but also participate in sports. And I think the spotlight was shown on the industry as a non-cyclical high-revenue-generating industry that people wanted more of.”    
    
Institutional investors have been among the biggest investors in sports teams in recent years, attracted by sharply higher valuations. “These returns historically have been very uncorrelated to other returns in the marketplace, which is attractive,” Dave Dase, Goldman Sachs'   Global Co-Head of Sports Investment Banking, tells podcast host Nicole Pullen Ross, who leads the sports and entertainment offering for Goldman Sachs' private wealth management practice. “These are very long-duration-oriented type assets. These are 25-, 50-, 75-, 100-year assets, and so a lot of this institutional capital or family office capital, or quite frankly, sovereign wealth or insurance capital is very, very long dated. So there's an alignment of interest there.” 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713598 
	

But institutional investors are also taking a different tack to investing in sports than they would in financial assets. “The currency in private equity is EBITDA and stock price and value creation. The currency in sports, to me, is creating memories and championships” says Josh Harris, founder of 26North, co-founder of private equity giant Apollo, as well as a renowned sports investor through Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment. “It's about having a great stadium, delivering a best-in-class experience for fans, and engaging with the cities in a positive way. You've got to be in this for the right reasons. I view myself as a steward for these cities. You've got to be all in, and invest to win, for players, for the fans, and for the city.”     
  
At the same time, how fans are consuming sports is being significantly disrupted. For one, technology innovation and the evolution of streaming platforms are bringing sports content to more people — wherever and whenever they want to consume it. “Brands [and] advertisers are desperate to find these aggregated audiences, and they're increasingly paying top dollar to do that, which makes the economic system work for the distributors, whether it be traditional or the new streaming platforms, and it certainly makes it for the leagues, the teams, and the players,” says Dase on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713599 the second episode  of  Investing in Sports .    
    
The leagues are also developing the sports themselves to boost viewers and fan engagement across more platforms.  “ I think the leagues have been behaving intelligently. They're recognizing they've got to make the product interesting,” says Gene Sykes, co-chair of Mergers and Acquisitions and Co-Chair of Global Technology, Media, and Telecom in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. “The more they can put more elements of dynamic surprise or drama in a shorter period, that helps. If they can possibly figure out how a baseball game can have more home runs, that's something people will come to the ballpark to watch, or they'll watch it on television or on the streaming platforms. Everything that helps the game have more interesting moments and be something in which it's part of the conversation.” 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Hedge funds' time to shine?

Attractive opportunities abound for hedge fund investors, speakers at Goldman Sachs' Alternatives Summit said.   
  
“This is one of the best times in my career to be investing in hedge funds,” says Jack Springate, Global Head of Hedge Funds within the Goldman Sachs External Investing Group.    
    
He predicts that greater performance disparities among assets should help skilled investors outperform their benchmarks. “This is a higher dispersion environment, you have a have higher cost of capital, and that should feed through to higher levels of alpha,” Springate said.     
    
Springate adds that there are wide performance differences among hedge funds as well, which is why “it really matters which hedge funds you partner with.”    
  
Bobby Jain, the CEO and CIO of recently created multi-strategy fund Jain Global, adds that as hedge funds have changed, so should their use in portfolios. He says that due to shifts in strategy, returns have become less market-dependent and more predictable, which means that “hedge funds have really moved from being an alternative to equities to being an alternative to fixed income.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

European energy storage: a new multi-billion-dollar asset class 	
	
	

	

Europe is rapidly transitioning towards renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, which are projected to provide 72% of the continent's electricity by 2050, up from 30% today,  according to Bloomberg NEF data.  However, the intermittent nature of renewables creates challenges in ensuring a reliable and consistent power supply.   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,6571359a Large-scale energy storage  is emerging as a solution — and an investment opportunity — to smooth out the imbalances caused by the variability of wind and solar generation.

“These technologies are positioned for the structural change to renewables that is happening in the electricity markets,” says Ingmar Grebien, who leads GS Pearl Street in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, of large-scale energy storage. GS Pearl Street is a platform for trading and financing solutions for clean energy technology. “That makes them an interesting new asset class to invest in, and also a great hedge for players that already have existing classic, renewable portfolios,” he says.    

Europe's energy storage capacity is expected to surge from 15 gigawatts in 2023 to around 375 gigawatts by 2050, according to Bloomberg NEF. Building this capacity will require up to $250 billion in investment and a significant evolution of the sector, Grebien and his team estimate.

Hedge funds and other private investment funds (collectively, “Alternative Investments”) are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled investment vehicles such as mutual funds.  Alternative Investments may impose significant fees, including incentive fees that are based upon a percentage of the realized and unrealized gains and an individual's net returns may differ significantly from actual returns.  Such fees may offset all or a significant portion of such Alternative Investment's trading profits. Alternative Investments are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information.  Investors may have limited rights with respect to their investments, including limited voting rights and participation in the management of such Alternative Investments.   
     
Alternative Investments often engage in leverage and other investment practices that are extremely speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Such practices may increase the volatility of performance and the risk of investment loss, including the loss of the entire amount that is invested. There may be conflicts of interest relating to the Alternative Investment and its service providers, including Goldman Sachs and its affiliates.  Similarly, interests in an Alternative Investment are highly illiquid and generally are not transferable without the consent of the sponsor, and applicable securities and tax laws will limit transfers.

Investing in sports: The next trillion-dollar market? 	
	
	

	

The sports ecosystem has exploded as an area of investment, with professional leagues loosening rules on private equity ownership, the value of media rights deals skyrocketing, and the many sports-adjacent businesses taking on new dimensions.

Hedge funds and other private investment funds (collectively, “Alternative Investments”) are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled investment vehicles such as mutual funds.  Alternative Investments may impose significant fees, including incentive fees that are based upon a percentage of the realized and unrealized gains and an individual's net returns may differ significantly from actual returns.  Such fees may offset all or a significant portion of such Alternative Investment's trading profits. Alternative Investments are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information.  Investors may have limited rights with respect to their investments, including limited voting rights and participation in the management of such Alternative Investments.   
     
Alternative Investments often engage in leverage and other investment practices that are extremely speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Such practices may increase the volatility of performance and the risk of investment loss, including the loss of the entire amount that is invested. There may be conflicts of interest relating to the Alternative Investment and its service providers, including Goldman Sachs and its affiliates.  Similarly, interests in an Alternative Investment are highly illiquid and generally are not transferable without the consent of the sponsor, and applicable securities and tax laws will limit transfers.

US GDP is forecast to outperform expectations in 2025 	
	
	

	

The world's largest economy is forecast to outperform economist expectations again next year,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713592 according to Goldman Sachs Research . US GDP is expected to grow 2.5% on a full-year basis, compared with 1.9% for the consensus forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.

“Recession fears have diminished, inflation is trending back toward 2%, and the labor market has rebalanced but remains strong,” David Mericle, chief US economist in Goldman Sachs Research, writes in the team's report, which is titled “2025 US Economic Outlook: New Policies, Similar Path." 

Three key policy changes following the Republican sweep in Washington are predicted to affect the economy:   

	- Tariff increases on imports from China and on autos may raise the effective tariff rate by 3 to 4 percentage points. 

	- Tighter policy may lower net immigration to 750,000 per year, moderately below the pre-pandemic average of 1 million per year.    

	- The 2017 tax cuts are expected to be fully extended instead of expiring and there will be modest additional tax cuts.   

While the expected policy changes are significant, Mericle doesn't anticipate that they will substantially alter the trajectory of the economy or monetary policy. Goldman Sachs Research forecasts the Federal Reserve will continue to cut the funds rate down to a terminal rate of 3.25-3.5% (the policy rate is 4.5% to 4.75% now).

"We still think you've got some upside to equities. You've got some upside to the dollar. You've got some outperformance of non-US bonds and European bond yields falling relative to the US." 

— Dominic Wilson, senior advisor in Global Markets Research, on the team's forecasts for the year ahead

Investing in sports: The next trillion-dollar market? 	
	
	

	

The sports ecosystem has exploded as an area of investment, with professional leagues loosening rules on private equity ownership, the value of media rights deals skyrocketing, and the many sports-adjacent businesses taking on new dimensions.   
    
Sports is a unique investment because of its addressable market, which is estimated to be just shy of 8 billion people, Elis Jones, Goldman Sachs' Head of Sports Investment Banking for EMEA, says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713597 the first episode of   Investing in Sports , a four-part series from the Goldman Sachs Exchanges podcast. “It's a hugely important pillar of society. And that was most evident through Covid, not only in the absence of being able to watch, but also participate in sports. And I think the spotlight was shown on the industry as a non-cyclical high-revenue-generating industry that people wanted more of.”    
    
Institutional investors have been among the biggest investors in sports teams in recent years, attracted by sharply higher valuations. “These returns historically have been very uncorrelated to other returns in the marketplace, which is attractive,” Dave Dase, Goldman Sachs'   Global Co-Head of Sports Investment Banking, tells podcast host Nicole Pullen Ross, who leads the sports and entertainment offering for Goldman Sachs' private wealth management practice. “These are very long-duration-oriented type assets. These are 25-, 50-, 75-, 100-year assets, and so a lot of this institutional capital or family office capital, or quite frankly, sovereign wealth or insurance capital is very, very long dated. So there's an alignment of interest there.” 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713598 
	

But institutional investors are also taking a different tack to investing in sports than they would in financial assets. “The currency in private equity is EBITDA and stock price and value creation. The currency in sports, to me, is creating memories and championships” says Josh Harris, founder of 26North, co-founder of private equity giant Apollo, as well as a renowned sports investor through Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment. “It's about having a great stadium, delivering a best-in-class experience for fans, and engaging with the cities in a positive way. You've got to be in this for the right reasons. I view myself as a steward for these cities. You've got to be all in, and invest to win, for players, for the fans, and for the city.”     
  
At the same time, how fans are consuming sports is being significantly disrupted. For one, technology innovation and the evolution of streaming platforms are bringing sports content to more people — wherever and whenever they want to consume it. “Brands [and] advertisers are desperate to find these aggregated audiences, and they're increasingly paying top dollar to do that, which makes the economic system work for the distributors, whether it be traditional or the new streaming platforms, and it certainly makes it for the leagues, the teams, and the players,” says Dase on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,65713599 the second episode  of  Investing in Sports .    
    
The leagues are also developing the sports themselves to boost viewers and fan engagement across more platforms.  “ I think the leagues have been behaving intelligently. They're recognizing they've got to make the product interesting,” says Gene Sykes, co-chair of Mergers and Acquisitions and Co-Chair of Global Technology, Media, and Telecom in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. “The more they can put more elements of dynamic surprise or drama in a shorter period, that helps. If they can possibly figure out how a baseball game can have more home runs, that's something people will come to the ballpark to watch, or they'll watch it on television or on the streaming platforms. Everything that helps the game have more interesting moments and be something in which it's part of the conversation.” 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Hedge funds' time to shine?

Attractive opportunities abound for hedge fund investors, speakers at Goldman Sachs' Alternatives Summit said.   
  
“This is one of the best times in my career to be investing in hedge funds,” says Jack Springate, Global Head of Hedge Funds within the Goldman Sachs External Investing Group.    
    
He predicts that greater performance disparities among assets should help skilled investors outperform their benchmarks. “This is a higher dispersion environment, you have a have higher cost of capital, and that should feed through to higher levels of alpha,” Springate said.     
    
Springate adds that there are wide performance differences among hedge funds as well, which is why “it really matters which hedge funds you partner with.”    
  
Bobby Jain, the CEO and CIO of recently created multi-strategy fund Jain Global, adds that as hedge funds have changed, so should their use in portfolios. He says that due to shifts in strategy, returns have become less market-dependent and more predictable, which means that “hedge funds have really moved from being an alternative to equities to being an alternative to fixed income.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

European energy storage: a new multi-billion-dollar asset class 	
	
	

	

Europe is rapidly transitioning towards renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, which are projected to provide 72% of the continent's electricity by 2050, up from 30% today,  according to Bloomberg NEF data.  However, the intermittent nature of renewables creates challenges in ensuring a reliable and consistent power supply.   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,6571359a Large-scale energy storage  is emerging as a solution — and an investment opportunity — to smooth out the imbalances caused by the variability of wind and solar generation. 

	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t314a1d1a,92a60511,6571359b 
	

“These technologies are positioned for the structural change to renewables that is happening in the electricity markets,” says Ingmar Grebien, who leads GS Pearl Street in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, of large-scale energy storage. GS Pearl Street is a platform for trading and financing solutions for clean energy technology. “That makes them an interesting new asset class to invest in, and also a great hedge for players that already have existing classic, renewable portfolios,” he says.    

Europe's energy storage capacity is expected to surge from 15 gigawatts in 2023 to around 375 gigawatts by 2050, according to Bloomberg NEF. Building this capacity will require up to $250 billion in investment and a significant evolution of the sector, Grebien and his team estimate.
