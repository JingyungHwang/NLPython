Will tariffs spark higher inflation? 	
	
	

	

President Donald Trump's administration has “signaled a willingness to take larger risks than the first time around,” raising the prospect of larger tariff increases, Chief US Economist David Mericle says in the latest episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494ca Goldman Sachs Exchanges . As a result, our economists now expect that the average US tariff rate will increase by 10 percentage points or more, which is likely to boost consumer prices. 

The higher tariff assumptions imply that that the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, core PCE, will rise to about 3%, Mericle notes. While tariffs on their own represent only a one-time change to the price level rather than a more meaningful shift in the pace of inflation, he says the risk that trade policy concerns spark broader changes to inflation expectations bears watching, given the attention from both consumers and businesses. “It is, I think, a little bit of surprise relative to what I might've expected several months back, just how focused businesses and consumers are on tariffs,” Mericle says. “I would say at the very least this is something to keep an eye on  — the risk of the tariffs sparking broader price increases.”

The larger tariffs are also likely to weigh on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494cc economic growth , says Mericle, whose team cut its 2025 GDP growth forecast on a Q4/Q4 basis from 2.2% to 1.7%. In addition to the tax-like impact of tariffs on disposable income and consumer spending, “the uncertainty that tariffs introduced are probably going to have a larger effect, discouraging business investment [more] than I would've thought a couple of months ago,” Mericle tells Exchanges host Allison Nathan.

The outlook for European tech unicorns 	
	
	

	

The   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494ce European tech  sector is poised for an increase in public listings in the years to come as a growing number of companies valued at $1 billion or more emerge, according to Clif Marriott in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets.  

The region's tech ecosystem has seen substantial growth, with around 350 unicorns emerging, up from fewer than 20 a decade ago. More than $425 billion has been invested in European tech over the past 10 years, compared with around $45 billion invested over the prior decade, according to a 2024 report from venture capital firm Atomico. 

Marriott, co-head of the Technology, Media & Telecommunications Group in EMEA, expects the number of global tech listings in public markets this year to be closer to the median number of yearly offerings (30) before the Covid pandemic, and up substantially from the lull in 2022-2023.  

Of the region's 350 unicorns, around 10% are expected to go public within the next five years, according to the participants on a venture capital panel at Goldman Sachs' 10th annual Disruptive Technology Symposium in London. Around 550 companies — and two-thirds of all European unicorns — have presented at the symposium since the event began. 

“While a number will go public on their own, some of those companies will need to merge or be acquired in order to access public markets,” Marriott adds.

How do tariffs impact the economy? 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d0 
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research reduced its prediction for US GDP expansion to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2025 (year over year) from its earlier estimate of 2.2%. Our economists point out that tariffs weigh on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d1 economic growth  via three main channels: 

	- They raise consumer prices — and thereby cut real income — by an estimated 0.1% per 1 percentage point increase in the average US tariff rate. (In theory, the drag could diminish if the tariff revenue is recycled into additional tax cuts, but this revenue will not be scored in the ongoing budget negotiations if it results from executive as opposed to congressional action.) 
	- Tariffs tend to tighten financial conditions, although the impact in this cycle looks smaller than in the 2018-2019 trade war when scaled by the size of the tariff hikes.  
	- Trade policy uncertainty leads businesses to delay investment.  
All told, the team's new baseline implies that tariffs will subtract an estimated 0.8 percentage points from GDP growth over the next year, with only 0.1-0.2 percentage points of this drag offset by the (relatively slow-moving) boost from tax cuts and regulatory easing.

Why European stocks are outperforming the US 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d3 
	

European equity markets have had a strong start to the year, outperforming their peers on the other side of the Atlantic. Even after the rally, Goldman Sachs Research expects European equities to rise as much as   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d4 7 % in the next 12 months . 

We spoke with Sharon Bell, senior strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, about her team's predictions for European stocks. 

Is there still room for European stocks to rise? 

I do still see upside for the remainder of this year. But I feel we've already had a lot of the returns for this year on European equities. 

The economic news for 2026 and 2027 has got better for Europe — our economists now expect German real GDP to expand 2% in 2027, mostly because of more government spending. That's a large change from a flatlining economy in recent years. But the market priced that news in quite quickly. 

How could potentially weaker US economic growth impact European equities? 

I think part of the selloff that we're seeing at the moment in US equities is people reassessing the impact of this trade policy uncertainty. And it does look like it's quite negative so far for the US economy — particularly for the consumer. We've seen consumer survey data on inflation expectations zoom up in the US. 
Around a quarter of European companies' exposure is to the US. If the US economy is not growing as fast as people expect, then Europe won't export as much to the US. 

Having said all of that, we still expect reasonably healthy US growth this year. And if growth does weaken further, then with interest rates at the level they are, there's always potential to soften financial conditions by bringing rates down. We don't expect a recession in the US, but a slightly softer patch of growth is not so good for European companies, either. 

What sectors look well-positioned for growth in Europe? 

Defense stocks have done extremely well recently. A basket of European defense stocks is up 67% since the start of this year (as of March 6). But that strong performance is partly based on future expectations. I think those stocks will probably still do well in the medium term, but there's going to be a lot of volatility given how high valuations are now. 

There are also some defensive sectors in Europe that are quite interesting. 

Healthcare is an area that we think has a lot of possibilities for the next few years and is not particularly expensive. We're also seeing consolidation in some areas of telecom, as well as regulators considering giving telecom companies more pricing power. Among cyclicals we like banks, which will benefit from improved European growth and higher long-term rates. Finally, we think that as well as defense stocks, fiscal spending and infrastructure companies more broadly should benefit.

Investors are still bullish on tech stocks 	
	
	

	

While US tech stocks have fallen in recent weeks, there are signs that investors are still bullish on the sector.

Will tariffs spark higher inflation? 	
	
	

	

President Donald Trump's administration has “signaled a willingness to take larger risks than the first time around,” raising the prospect of larger tariff increases, Chief US Economist David Mericle says in the latest episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494ca Goldman Sachs Exchanges . As a result, our economists now expect that the average US tariff rate will increase by 10 percentage points or more, which is likely to boost consumer prices. 

The higher tariff assumptions imply that that the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, core PCE, will rise to about 3%, Mericle notes. While tariffs on their own represent only a one-time change to the price level rather than a more meaningful shift in the pace of inflation, he says the risk that trade policy concerns spark broader changes to inflation expectations bears watching, given the attention from both consumers and businesses. “It is, I think, a little bit of surprise relative to what I might've expected several months back, just how focused businesses and consumers are on tariffs,” Mericle says. “I would say at the very least this is something to keep an eye on  — the risk of the tariffs sparking broader price increases.”

The larger tariffs are also likely to weigh on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494cc economic growth , says Mericle, whose team cut its 2025 GDP growth forecast on a Q4/Q4 basis from 2.2% to 1.7%. In addition to the tax-like impact of tariffs on disposable income and consumer spending, “the uncertainty that tariffs introduced are probably going to have a larger effect, discouraging business investment [more] than I would've thought a couple of months ago,” Mericle tells Exchanges host Allison Nathan.

The outlook for European tech unicorns 	
	
	

	

The   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494ce European tech  sector is poised for an increase in public listings in the years to come as a growing number of companies valued at $1 billion or more emerge, according to Clif Marriott in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets.  

The region's tech ecosystem has seen substantial growth, with around 350 unicorns emerging, up from fewer than 20 a decade ago. More than $425 billion has been invested in European tech over the past 10 years, compared with around $45 billion invested over the prior decade, according to a 2024 report from venture capital firm Atomico. 

Marriott, co-head of the Technology, Media & Telecommunications Group in EMEA, expects the number of global tech listings in public markets this year to be closer to the median number of yearly offerings (30) before the Covid pandemic, and up substantially from the lull in 2022-2023.  

Of the region's 350 unicorns, around 10% are expected to go public within the next five years, according to the participants on a venture capital panel at Goldman Sachs' 10th annual Disruptive Technology Symposium in London. Around 550 companies — and two-thirds of all European unicorns — have presented at the symposium since the event began. 

“While a number will go public on their own, some of those companies will need to merge or be acquired in order to access public markets,” Marriott adds.

How do tariffs impact the economy? 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d0 
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research reduced its prediction for US GDP expansion to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2025 (year over year) from its earlier estimate of 2.2%. Our economists point out that tariffs weigh on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d1 economic growth  via three main channels: 

	- They raise consumer prices — and thereby cut real income — by an estimated 0.1% per 1 percentage point increase in the average US tariff rate. (In theory, the drag could diminish if the tariff revenue is recycled into additional tax cuts, but this revenue will not be scored in the ongoing budget negotiations if it results from executive as opposed to congressional action.) 
	- Tariffs tend to tighten financial conditions, although the impact in this cycle looks smaller than in the 2018-2019 trade war when scaled by the size of the tariff hikes.  
	- Trade policy uncertainty leads businesses to delay investment.  
All told, the team's new baseline implies that tariffs will subtract an estimated 0.8 percentage points from GDP growth over the next year, with only 0.1-0.2 percentage points of this drag offset by the (relatively slow-moving) boost from tax cuts and regulatory easing.

Why European stocks are outperforming the US 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d3 
	

European equity markets have had a strong start to the year, outperforming their peers on the other side of the Atlantic. Even after the rally, Goldman Sachs Research expects European equities to rise as much as   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d4 7 % in the next 12 months . 

We spoke with Sharon Bell, senior strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, about her team's predictions for European stocks. 

Is there still room for European stocks to rise? 

I do still see upside for the remainder of this year. But I feel we've already had a lot of the returns for this year on European equities. 

The economic news for 2026 and 2027 has got better for Europe — our economists now expect German real GDP to expand 2% in 2027, mostly because of more government spending. That's a large change from a flatlining economy in recent years. But the market priced that news in quite quickly. 

How could potentially weaker US economic growth impact European equities? 

I think part of the selloff that we're seeing at the moment in US equities is people reassessing the impact of this trade policy uncertainty. And it does look like it's quite negative so far for the US economy — particularly for the consumer. We've seen consumer survey data on inflation expectations zoom up in the US. 
Around a quarter of European companies' exposure is to the US. If the US economy is not growing as fast as people expect, then Europe won't export as much to the US. 

Having said all of that, we still expect reasonably healthy US growth this year. And if growth does weaken further, then with interest rates at the level they are, there's always potential to soften financial conditions by bringing rates down. We don't expect a recession in the US, but a slightly softer patch of growth is not so good for European companies, either. 

What sectors look well-positioned for growth in Europe? 

Defense stocks have done extremely well recently. A basket of European defense stocks is up 67% since the start of this year (as of March 6). But that strong performance is partly based on future expectations. I think those stocks will probably still do well in the medium term, but there's going to be a lot of volatility given how high valuations are now. 

There are also some defensive sectors in Europe that are quite interesting. 

Healthcare is an area that we think has a lot of possibilities for the next few years and is not particularly expensive. We're also seeing consolidation in some areas of telecom, as well as regulators considering giving telecom companies more pricing power. Among cyclicals we like banks, which will benefit from improved European growth and higher long-term rates. Finally, we think that as well as defense stocks, fiscal spending and infrastructure companies more broadly should benefit.

Investors are still bullish on tech stocks 	
	
	

	

While US tech stocks have fallen in recent weeks, there are signs that investors are still bullish on the sector. Some 70% of respondents to a survey during the 10 th  annual Goldman Sachs   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t34cf81de,9741b8a8,657494d6 Disruptive Technology Symposium  in London said they expect the Nasdaq Index to be flat or higher in 12 months.
