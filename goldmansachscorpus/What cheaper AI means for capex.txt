The introduction of low-cost generative artificial intelligence models is raising questions about whether the high spending on AI by the world's largest technology companies is justified.  

"This is unambiguously good news," says Kim Posnett, global co-head of investment banking in Goldman Sachs' Global Banking & Markets business, on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a20 our Exchanges podcast . "The cost of compute is coming down dramatically. The price per token is coming down dramatically. That means these models are becoming more cost efficient. It is great for the world that this will be cheaper for all of us."  

The emergence of lower-cost AI models also promises more efficient ways to train AI on large datasets, says George Lee, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute and the firm's former CIO. These models may "promise much more efficient ways of pre-training," Lee says, and "reduce the amount of capital we have to allocate to at least part of this ecosystem." While the decline in potential capital and token costs appears sudden, "this is part of a repeated history of the way that technology happens," Lee says. "It's a measurable but small blip in a steeply declining overall curve." 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

	

February QuickPoll: Inflation and geopolitics 	
	
	

	

Financial markets were buffeted this week amid trade tensions between the US and its largest trade partners. However,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a21 sticky inflation  was seen as a bigger risk to the US exceptionalism theme than tariffs, according to the latest Marquee QuickPoll, which surveyed nearly 800 respondents in early February (the poll closed on February 5). Key highlights include: 

	- US economic data (43%) and geopolitics (42%) are the two biggest risks on investors' minds this month. "The focus on geopolitics reached levels not seen since April 2022 - the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war - as markets navigate policy-driven volatility," says Goldman Sachs' Oscar Ostlund, global head of Content Strategy, Market Analytics, and Data Science. 
	- Investors are particularly focused on sticky inflation, singling it out as the biggest threat to the US exceptionalism theme. And some may be concerned that tariffs could keep prices elevated, according to the results. Notably, only 13% picked AI-related concerns as a risk here. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

	- And despite the recent selloff in the tech sector sparked by the introduction of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model, 51% of respondents didn't change their tech or Magnificent 7 allocations. About a third moved towards defensives, while 21% moved towards non-US stocks. "Lack of ROI is the biggest concern for AI investors, even more so in the post-DeepSeek era, where focus for the first time turned towards AI names outside of the US," Ostlund says. 
	- In terms of favorite long trades, developed-market equities took the lead by a large margin, followed by gold. And while investors were still bullish on risk assets (on net), the bearish tone continued rising on the margin.

The S&P 500 fell by a cumulative total of 5% across all the days on which the US announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019, according to Goldman Sachs Research. It fell by slightly more - a cumulative total of 7% - across the days when other  countries announced retaliatory tariffs.

IPO activity in Europe is expected to rise in 2025 	
	
	

	

IPO volumes rose strongly in Europe in 2024, signaling a gradual rebound after two years of subdued issuance. There are signs that public offerings will climb again this year, according to Richard Cormack in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. 

Cormack points out that the region's IPO volume last year, while up about 80% from 2024, was still about a third below the longer-term average. "We should be getting closer to normalized volumes this year," says Cormack, the head of Equity Capital Markets in EMEA. He says the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a23 calendar for potential public offerings  is busier than it was a year ago, and there are more conversations in particular with private equity sponsors. 

	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a24 
	

He notes that the discount that investors sought for investing in an IPO narrowed over 2024. As that discount continues to shrink, issuers have become more comfortable embarking on public offerings. 

Some companies have attracted attention by changing their listings from London to New York. Cormack says there are companies from the UK and the rest of Europe that are particularly predisposed to listing in the US - businesses that are geographically exposed to the US and high-growth companies that won't see profitability until further into the future. He points out that there's more willingness to value the latter among US investors, and a deeper pool of capital to fund them. 

"Outside of those two conditions, I don't think you'll see a flood of indigenous UK or indigenous European non-tech, non-biopharma companies list outside of their home markets," Cormack says. 

In case you missed it:  Despite the rise in gilt yields, UK interest rates are  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a25 forecast to fall  in 2025. 

	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

AI to drive 165% increase in data center power demand 	
	
	

	

The explosion in interest in generative  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a26 artificial intelligence  has resulted in an arms race to develop the technology, which will require vast numbers of high-density data centers as well as the electricity to power them. 

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a27 Goldman Sachs Research forecasts  global power demand from data centers to increase 50% by 2027 and by as much as 165% by the end of the decade (compared with 2023), writes James Schneider, a senior equity research analyst covering US telecom, digital infrastructure, and IT services, in the team's report. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a28 

The balance between data center supply and demand is forecast by Goldman Sachs Research to tighten in the coming years. The occupancy rate for this infrastructure is projected to increase from around 85% in 2023 to a potential peak of more than 95% in late 2026. That will likely be followed by a moderation starting in 2027, as more data centers come online and AI-driven demand growth slows. 

These trends will open up new opportunities for investors, particularly in hyperscale cloud providers, power utilities, asset managers, and data center operators, according to Schneider.

How will falling AI costs affect infrastructure spending?

The introduction of low-cost generative artificial intelligence models is raising questions about whether the high spending on AI by the world's largest technology companies is justified.  

"This is unambiguously good news," says Kim Posnett, global co-head of investment banking in Goldman Sachs' Global Banking & Markets business, on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a20 our Exchanges podcast . "The cost of compute is coming down dramatically. The price per token is coming down dramatically. That means these models are becoming more cost efficient. It is great for the world that this will be cheaper for all of us."  

The emergence of lower-cost AI models also promises more efficient ways to train AI on large datasets, says George Lee, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute and the firm's former CIO. These models may "promise much more efficient ways of pre-training," Lee says, and "reduce the amount of capital we have to allocate to at least part of this ecosystem." While the decline in potential capital and token costs appears sudden, "this is part of a repeated history of the way that technology happens," Lee says. "It's a measurable but small blip in a steeply declining overall curve." 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

	

February QuickPoll: Inflation and geopolitics 	
	
	

	

Financial markets were buffeted this week amid trade tensions between the US and its largest trade partners. However,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a21 sticky inflation  was seen as a bigger risk to the US exceptionalism theme than tariffs, according to the latest Marquee QuickPoll, which surveyed nearly 800 respondents in early February (the poll closed on February 5). Key highlights include: 

	- US economic data (43%) and geopolitics (42%) are the two biggest risks on investors' minds this month. "The focus on geopolitics reached levels not seen since April 2022 - the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war - as markets navigate policy-driven volatility," says Goldman Sachs' Oscar Ostlund, global head of Content Strategy, Market Analytics, and Data Science. 
	- Investors are particularly focused on sticky inflation, singling it out as the biggest threat to the US exceptionalism theme. And some may be concerned that tariffs could keep prices elevated, according to the results. Notably, only 13% picked AI-related concerns as a risk here. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

	- And despite the recent selloff in the tech sector sparked by the introduction of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model, 51% of respondents didn't change their tech or Magnificent 7 allocations. About a third moved towards defensives, while 21% moved towards non-US stocks. "Lack of ROI is the biggest concern for AI investors, even more so in the post-DeepSeek era, where focus for the first time turned towards AI names outside of the US," Ostlund says. 
	- In terms of favorite long trades, developed-market equities took the lead by a large margin, followed by gold. And while investors were still bullish on risk assets (on net), the bearish tone continued rising on the margin.

How do tariff announcements impact the US stock market? The experience of the previous Trump administration offers some clues. 

	
	
	

	

	
  
	

	

The S&P 500 fell by a cumulative total of 5% across all the days on which the US announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019, according to Goldman Sachs Research. It fell by slightly more - a cumulative total of 7% - across the days when other  countries announced retaliatory tariffs.

IPO activity in Europe is expected to rise in 2025 	
	
	

	

IPO volumes rose strongly in Europe in 2024, signaling a gradual rebound after two years of subdued issuance. There are signs that public offerings will climb again this year, according to Richard Cormack in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. 

Cormack points out that the region's IPO volume last year, while up about 80% from 2024, was still about a third below the longer-term average. "We should be getting closer to normalized volumes this year," says Cormack, the head of Equity Capital Markets in EMEA. He says the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a23 calendar for potential public offerings  is busier than it was a year ago, and there are more conversations in particular with private equity sponsors.

He notes that the discount that investors sought for investing in an IPO narrowed over 2024. As that discount continues to shrink, issuers have become more comfortable embarking on public offerings. 

Some companies have attracted attention by changing their listings from London to New York. Cormack says there are companies from the UK and the rest of Europe that are particularly predisposed to listing in the US - businesses that are geographically exposed to the US and high-growth companies that won't see profitability until further into the future. He points out that there's more willingness to value the latter among US investors, and a deeper pool of capital to fund them. 

"Outside of those two conditions, I don't think you'll see a flood of indigenous UK or indigenous European non-tech, non-biopharma companies list outside of their home markets," Cormack says. 

In case you missed it:  Despite the rise in gilt yields, UK interest rates are  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a25 forecast to fall  in 2025. 

	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

AI to drive 165% increase in data center power demand 	
	
	

	

The explosion in interest in generative  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a26 artificial intelligence  has resulted in an arms race to develop the technology, which will require vast numbers of high-density data centers as well as the electricity to power them. 

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a27 Goldman Sachs Research forecasts  global power demand from data centers to increase 50% by 2027 and by as much as 165% by the end of the decade (compared with 2023), writes James Schneider, a senior equity research analyst covering US telecom, digital infrastructure, and IT services, in the team's report. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3408bfe2,95e10f50,65737a28 

The balance between data center supply and demand is forecast by Goldman Sachs Research to tighten in the coming years. The occupancy rate for this infrastructure is projected to increase from around 85% in 2023 to a potential peak of more than 95% in late 2026. That will likely be followed by a moderation starting in 2027, as more data centers come online and AI-driven demand growth slows. 

These trends will open up new opportunities for investors, particularly in hyperscale cloud providers, power utilities, asset managers, and data center operators, according to Schneider.
