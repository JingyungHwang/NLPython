The case for megacap tech 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e142f 

The bullish case for megacap tech stocks remains intact, according to Peter Callahan, the US Technology, Media and Telecommunications sector specialist within Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. 

The biggest tech stocks, dubbed the “Magnificent 7,” fell sharply in July and early August. Callahan says the drop reflects mixed earnings reports and growing skepticism about AI. 

The AI theme “has ebbed and flowed a bit, with investors oscillating between ‘This is very exciting, and this is going to change everything' to ‘The cost is really high, and it's going to take some time for this to monetize and really be impactful for an enterprise or a consumer environment,'" Callahan tells Mike Washington, equities sales trader with Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1430 on The Markets podcast . 

Yet Callahan remains optimistic. “I think the tech story is far from debunked, given strong defensive plus secular growth opportunities within these businesses — and, frankly, a generative AI story that is more ahead of us than behind us.”

The rapid unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade has sent shock waves through global markets. A surprise rate hike from the Bank of Japan, combined with the prospect of more rapid cuts by the Federal Reserve, narrowed the spread that investors were earning by borrowing in Japan's low-yielding currency to invest in higher-yielding currencies like the US dollar and the Mexican peso. 

“When you have markets at a high level, [and] when you have particular trades that are very highly crowded and concentrated, it doesn't take very much to move things the other way,” Kamakshya Trivedi, head of Global Foreign Exchange, Interest Rates, and Emerging Markets Strategy with Goldman Sachs Research,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1432 says on the Exchanges podcast .  

“There were some genuine fundamental reasons for some degree of unwind in the yen carry trade specifically that we talked about — some genuine fundamental shifts in the macroeconomic picture in Japan and the US," Trivedi says. "But some of the broader volatility does feel to me like it's a few different things that came together in a perfect storm.” 

Many faster-moving investors, such as hedge funds, dumped out of the trade around the same time, says Praneet Shah, co-head of Global G10 FX Options Trading with Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. As a result, several strategies correlated to the yen carry trade suffered rapid exits as well. 

“You have this negative feedback loop,” Shah says. He explains that the rapid unwind of the yen carry trade led to a “position purge…that ended up in positions needing to be pared down across the board.” For that reason, the swift move in the yen “had a pretty widespread impact across other markets.”

Only a quarter of Saudi Arabia's $1 trillion capex plan will go into oil 	
	
	

In what Goldman Sachs Research calls a “capex super-cycle,” Saudi Arabia is expected to invest $1 trillion across six strategic sectors by 2030. But the oil industry is likely to receive a smaller portion of this than previously forecast. 

Roughly 73% of the investment funds will go to non-oil sectors, Faisal AlAzmeh, who heads CEEMEA equity research and covers natural resources, chemicals, and infrastructure in the Middle East,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1434 writes in his team's report . An earlier forecast pegged non-oil investment at 66%.  
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1435 
	

Clean energy is expected to get $235 billion in funding, up from a previous forecast of $148 billion, with the energy transition remaining a core focus for spending. Saudi Arabia is also funding sectors that enable an economic diversification away from oil, such as metals and minerals, transport and logistics, and digitalization. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

How AI investment is flowing into Europe's chip companies 	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1436 
	

As companies explore new generative artificial intelligence technologies, immense spending on the required infrastructure is underway. At the same time, investors are debating the extent to which reality will keep pace with the extraordinary hopes for AI technology. 

In Europe, some of that money is being spent to boost digital enablers — companies with technology vital to build the chips powering the data centers that run the AI models. Double digit boosts to longer-term earnings power for certain digital enablers in Europe are possible, with beneficiaries in Germany, France, and especially the Netherlands,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1437  according to Goldman Sachs Research . 

“The sheer scale of investment on the hardware side globally is clearly having an impact on a regional basis in Europe, affecting the digital enablers — the companies needed to make the AI expansion possible,” says Goldman Sachs Research analyst Alexander Duval. 

In case you missed it:  Read   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1438 our previous article  on whether the $1 trillion in generative AI investment will pay off.  
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

How markets are reacting to Middle East tensions 	
	
	

As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to spike, threatening to spill over into a broader war, markets have reacted — but not as sharply as might have been expected. Sam Morgan, co-head of One Goldman Sachs and global head of FICC sales, says regional assets, such as US dollar-Israeli shekel exchange rates, have been impacted and gyrated in recent months. 

“But the impact on commodities has been fairly limited. The oil price is currently down on the month, and global equity and bond markets have been focused elsewhere,” Morgan says. The primary drivers of recent moves in the equity market have been changing perceptions around the timing and magnitude of Fed cuts, US employment and inflation data, tech earnings and AI developments, rather than the Middle East conflict. 

Usually, tensions in the Middle East impact global growth through the price of oil. To date, the oil market has largely shrugged off geopolitical concerns and focused on the impact on demand of US and China growth slowdowns (and the potential impact of the US election on oil supply). To be sure, a further escalation of the conflict could push up oil prices if critical oil infrastructure were endangered. But the broader lesson remains that the markets focus first and foremost on the economy and policy, Morgan says. “Geopolitical tensions have major impacts on specific companies, sectors (such as defense), and countries. But for global impacts, there needs to be a direct knock-on to growth, inflation (via oil prices, say), or monetary and fiscal policy.”

The AI theme “has ebbed and flowed a bit, with investors oscillating between ‘This is very exciting, and this is going to change everything' to ‘The cost is really high, and it's going to take some time for this to monetize and really be impactful for an enterprise or a consumer environment,'" Callahan tells Mike Washington, equities sales trader with Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1430 on The Markets podcast . 

Yet Callahan remains optimistic. “I think the tech story is far from debunked, given strong defensive plus secular growth opportunities within these businesses — and, frankly, a generative AI story that is more ahead of us than behind us.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

The huge impacts of the yen carry trade

The rapid unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade has sent shock waves through global markets. A surprise rate hike from the Bank of Japan, combined with the prospect of more rapid cuts by the Federal Reserve, narrowed the spread that investors were earning by borrowing in Japan's low-yielding currency to invest in higher-yielding currencies like the US dollar and the Mexican peso. 

“When you have markets at a high level, [and] when you have particular trades that are very highly crowded and concentrated, it doesn't take very much to move things the other way,” Kamakshya Trivedi, head of Global Foreign Exchange, Interest Rates, and Emerging Markets Strategy with Goldman Sachs Research,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1432 says on the Exchanges podcast .  

“There were some genuine fundamental reasons for some degree of unwind in the yen carry trade specifically that we talked about — some genuine fundamental shifts in the macroeconomic picture in Japan and the US," Trivedi says. "But some of the broader volatility does feel to me like it's a few different things that came together in a perfect storm.” 

Many faster-moving investors, such as hedge funds, dumped out of the trade around the same time, says Praneet Shah, co-head of Global G10 FX Options Trading with Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets. As a result, several strategies correlated to the yen carry trade suffered rapid exits as well. 

“You have this negative feedback loop,” Shah says. He explains that the rapid unwind of the yen carry trade led to a “position purge…that ended up in positions needing to be pared down across the board.” For that reason, the swift move in the yen “had a pretty widespread impact across other markets.”

Only a quarter of Saudi Arabia's $1 trillion capex plan will go into oil 	
	
	

In what Goldman Sachs Research calls a “capex super-cycle,” Saudi Arabia is expected to invest $1 trillion across six strategic sectors by 2030. But the oil industry is likely to receive a smaller portion of this than previously forecast. 

Roughly 73% of the investment funds will go to non-oil sectors, Faisal AlAzmeh, who heads CEEMEA equity research and covers natural resources, chemicals, and infrastructure in the Middle East,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1434 writes in his team's report . An earlier forecast pegged non-oil investment at 66%.

Clean energy is expected to get $235 billion in funding, up from a previous forecast of $148 billion, with the energy transition remaining a core focus for spending. Saudi Arabia is also funding sectors that enable an economic diversification away from oil, such as metals and minerals, transport and logistics, and digitalization. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

How AI investment is flowing into Europe's chip companies

As companies explore new generative artificial intelligence technologies, immense spending on the required infrastructure is underway. At the same time, investors are debating the extent to which reality will keep pace with the extraordinary hopes for AI technology. 

In Europe, some of that money is being spent to boost digital enablers — companies with technology vital to build the chips powering the data centers that run the AI models. Double digit boosts to longer-term earnings power for certain digital enablers in Europe are possible, with beneficiaries in Germany, France, and especially the Netherlands,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2ea943bc,8e4e0fa5,656e1437  according to Goldman Sachs Research . 

“The sheer scale of investment on the hardware side globally is clearly having an impact on a regional basis in Europe, affecting the digital enablers — the companies needed to make the AI expansion possible,” says Goldman Sachs Research analyst Alexander Duval.

How markets are reacting to Middle East tensions 	
	
	

As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to spike, threatening to spill over into a broader war, markets have reacted — but not as sharply as might have been expected. Sam Morgan, co-head of One Goldman Sachs and global head of FICC sales, says regional assets, such as US dollar-Israeli shekel exchange rates, have been impacted and gyrated in recent months. 

“But the impact on commodities has been fairly limited. The oil price is currently down on the month, and global equity and bond markets have been focused elsewhere,” Morgan says. The primary drivers of recent moves in the equity market have been changing perceptions around the timing and magnitude of Fed cuts, US employment and inflation data, tech earnings and AI developments, rather than the Middle East conflict. 

Usually, tensions in the Middle East impact global growth through the price of oil. To date, the oil market has largely shrugged off geopolitical concerns and focused on the impact on demand of US and China growth slowdowns (and the potential impact of the US election on oil supply). To be sure, a further escalation of the conflict could push up oil prices if critical oil infrastructure were endangered. But the broader lesson remains that the markets focus first and foremost on the economy and policy, Morgan says. “Geopolitical tensions have major impacts on specific companies, sectors (such as defense), and countries. But for global impacts, there needs to be a direct knock-on to growth, inflation (via oil prices, say), or monetary and fiscal policy.”
