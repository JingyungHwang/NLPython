The S&P 500 is forecast to return 10% in 2025 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,6571681e 
	

The S&P 500 is forecast to have its third-straight year of gains amid solid economic expansion and steady earnings growth,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,6571681f according to Goldman Sachs Research . 

The benchmark index of US equities is projected to rise to 6,500 by the end of 2025, a 9% price gain from its current level and a 10% total return including dividends (as of November 26), David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, writes in the team's report. Earnings are predicted to increase 11% in 2025 and 7% in 2026. 

	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716820 
	

Corporate revenue growth (at the index level) is typically in line with nominal GDP growth, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our strategists' estimate of 5% sales growth for the S&P 500 is consistent with   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716821 our economists' forecasts  for 2.5% real GDP growth and for inflation to cool to 2.4% by the end of next year. 

Goldman Sachs Research's S&P 500 EPS forecasts for 2025 and 2026 are $268 and $288, in line with the median top-down consensus estimates of $268 and $288. However, these are below the bottom-up consensus (based on individual company earnings estimates made by equity analysts) of $274 and $308. 

According to Goldman Sachs Research's baseline macroeconomic outlook, the economy and earnings will continue to grow and bond yields will remain around current levels in the coming years. But there are a number of risks heading into 2025, including the potential threat of an across-the-board tariff and the potential of higher bond yields. At the other end of the spectrum, a friendlier mix of fiscal policy or more dovish policy from the Federal Reserve could result in higher returns. 

In case you missed it:  Read   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716822 our previous article  on Goldman Sachs Research's outlook for the US economy in 2025. 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

The outlook for Europe in 2025 	
	
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research forecasts   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716823 continued growth for the euro area in 2025  — but several factors will have a significant drag on the economy. Anticipated tariffs imposed by the US President-elect Donald Trump, high energy prices, and competition from Chinese manufacturing are expected to weigh on the bloc. Our economists predict areawide growth of 0.8% for 2025, notably below the consensus forecast of 1.2%. 

Even so, a euro-area recession is unlikely, Jari Stehn, Goldman Sachs Research's chief European economist, writes in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716824 the team's report . Consumer spending in the bloc is expected to recover given real rising incomes and elevated savings, and underlying inflation is declining. Goldman Sachs Research expects headline and core inflation to return to 2% by the end of 2025. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716825 
	

Some European economies are likely to prove more resilient than others. German GDP is expected to contract 0.3% and France's economy will shrink by 0.7%, while Spain's GDP (again outperforming) will increase by 2%. 

Given the outlook for subdued growth, Stehn expects the euro area unemployment rate to rise next year, reaching 6.7% by early 2026. Continued disinflation will lead to “rising pressures” for the European Central Bank to lower rates, he writes. Goldman Sachs Research expects the Governing Council to cut the deposit rate to 1.75% in July (from 3.25% in October). 

The UK economy, meanwhile,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716826 is forecast to expand 1.2% in 2025 , up from an estimated 0.9% this year. While inflation is predicted to cool materially, several longer-term structural challenges are likely to be in focus. The country's limited fiscal flexibility and the trajectory of government debt may be under scrutiny. There's also more uncertainty around Britain's future trading arrangements with the US following Trump's re-election, even as the government is likely to make progress on trading relations with the EU. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

How Draghi's plan for electrification could boost Europe's economy 	
	
	

	

Electrification, a key piece of the puzzle to reduce carbon emissions, could also boost the European economy. 

Europe should   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716827 increase overall investment  by about €800 billion  ($867 billion) a year,  according to a report on European competitiveness from Mario Draghi , former head of the European Central Bank. More than half of that sum would be for clean energy (€300 billion) and electric mobility (€150 billion). Draghi was asked by the EU to examine how to boost private investment and close the productivity gap with the US. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716828 
	

The cost of electricity is one of the reasons for the disparity in productivity between the US and Europe, Alberto Gandolfi, head of European utilities for Goldman Sachs Research, writes about Draghi's analysis. Europe's ability to compete with the US economy has worsened in recent decades, with the labor productivity gap widening to about 25% today from 5% in 1995, according to data from Eurostat and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  

Meanwhile a typical large car manufacturing facility in Europe may pay an extra €500 million a year compared with a US competitor, while a chemical plant could face annual excess costs of €1 billion. “Electrification, thanks to low-cost renewable energy, could narrow the gap and lead to largely fixed power bills,” Gandolfi writes. 

Altogether, electrification is at the core of Draghi's plan. His analysis envisions approximately €3–€4 trillion in spending on electrification and energy transition over 10 years, or about a quarter of eurozone GDP. Goldman Sachs Research expects this to drive a capital expenditure supercycle in electrification infrastructure. 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

How Clearlake Capital's José E. Feliciano finds value across private markets

José  E. Feliciano (R.), Clearlake Capital's co-founder and managing partner, with Michael Brandmeyer, global head and chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management's  External Investing Group, on Goldman Sachs Exchanges 
	
	
	

Despite a subdued dealmaking environment in the private equity industry, Clearlake Capital's José E. Feliciano sees interesting opportunities that the firm can invest in, thanks in part to Clearlake's flexible investment mandate. “We do see a reopening of the capital markets,” Feliciano, co-founder and managing partner of the investment firm, says in a conversation with Goldman Sachs' Michael Brandmeyer on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,6571682a Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .  

“We do think that there's going to be very selective opportunities in the buyout side. There's going to be really interesting opportunities in what we call special situations, things like carve-outs, turnarounds. And we do see idiosyncratic, distressed, or special situations where there are really interesting opportunities to buy companies or [access] those companies through debt or restructurings.” 

In particular, Feliciano sees opportunities to invest in the large proprietary datasets that are powering generative artificial intelligence. “The best example is probably within healthcare IT, where big datasets are generated,” he says. “That dataset is extremely important for that machine to learn and potentially translate to better outcomes, better predictability of outcomes, better forecasting, and hopefully in the case of healthcare, better treatment...So we think that AI ultimately will be a force for good.”

The S&P 500 is forecast to return 10% in 2025 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,6571681e 
	

The S&P 500 is forecast to have its third-straight year of gains amid solid economic expansion and steady earnings growth,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,6571681f according to Goldman Sachs Research . 

The benchmark index of US equities is projected to rise to 6,500 by the end of 2025, a 9% price gain from its current level and a 10% total return including dividends (as of November 26), David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, writes in the team's report. Earnings are predicted to increase 11% in 2025 and 7% in 2026. 

	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716820 
	

Corporate revenue growth (at the index level) is typically in line with nominal GDP growth, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our strategists' estimate of 5% sales growth for the S&P 500 is consistent with   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716821 our economists' forecasts  for 2.5% real GDP growth and for inflation to cool to 2.4% by the end of next year. 

Goldman Sachs Research's S&P 500 EPS forecasts for 2025 and 2026 are $268 and $288, in line with the median top-down consensus estimates of $268 and $288. However, these are below the bottom-up consensus (based on individual company earnings estimates made by equity analysts) of $274 and $308. 

According to Goldman Sachs Research's baseline macroeconomic outlook, the economy and earnings will continue to grow and bond yields will remain around current levels in the coming years. But there are a number of risks heading into 2025, including the potential threat of an across-the-board tariff and the potential of higher bond yields. At the other end of the spectrum, a friendlier mix of fiscal policy or more dovish policy from the Federal Reserve could result in higher returns. 

In case you missed it:  Read   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716822 our previous article  on Goldman Sachs Research's outlook for the US economy in 2025. 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

The outlook for Europe in 2025 	
	
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research forecasts   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716823 continued growth for the euro area in 2025  — but several factors will have a significant drag on the economy. Anticipated tariffs imposed by the US President-elect Donald Trump, high energy prices, and competition from Chinese manufacturing are expected to weigh on the bloc. Our economists predict areawide growth of 0.8% for 2025, notably below the consensus forecast of 1.2%. 

Even so, a euro-area recession is unlikely, Jari Stehn, Goldman Sachs Research's chief European economist, writes in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716824 the team's report . Consumer spending in the bloc is expected to recover given real rising incomes and elevated savings, and underlying inflation is declining. Goldman Sachs Research expects headline and core inflation to return to 2% by the end of 2025. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716825 
	

Some European economies are likely to prove more resilient than others. German GDP is expected to contract 0.3% and France's economy will shrink by 0.7%, while Spain's GDP (again outperforming) will increase by 2%. 

Given the outlook for subdued growth, Stehn expects the euro area unemployment rate to rise next year, reaching 6.7% by early 2026. Continued disinflation will lead to “rising pressures” for the European Central Bank to lower rates, he writes. Goldman Sachs Research expects the Governing Council to cut the deposit rate to 1.75% in July (from 3.25% in October). 

The UK economy, meanwhile,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716826 is forecast to expand 1.2% in 2025 , up from an estimated 0.9% this year. While inflation is predicted to cool materially, several longer-term structural challenges are likely to be in focus. The country's limited fiscal flexibility and the trajectory of government debt may be under scrutiny. There's also more uncertainty around Britain's future trading arrangements with the US following Trump's re-election, even as the government is likely to make progress on trading relations with the EU. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

How Draghi's plan for electrification could boost Europe's economy 	
	
	

	

Electrification, a key piece of the puzzle to reduce carbon emissions, could also boost the European economy. 

Europe should   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716827 increase overall investment  by about €800 billion  ($867 billion) a year,  according to a report on European competitiveness from Mario Draghi , former head of the European Central Bank. More than half of that sum would be for clean energy (€300 billion) and electric mobility (€150 billion). Draghi was asked by the EU to examine how to boost private investment and close the productivity gap with the US. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,65716828 
	

The cost of electricity is one of the reasons for the disparity in productivity between the US and Europe, Alberto Gandolfi, head of European utilities for Goldman Sachs Research, writes about Draghi's analysis. Europe's ability to compete with the US economy has worsened in recent decades, with the labor productivity gap widening to about 25% today from 5% in 1995, according to data from Eurostat and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  

Meanwhile a typical large car manufacturing facility in Europe may pay an extra €500 million a year compared with a US competitor, while a chemical plant could face annual excess costs of €1 billion. “Electrification, thanks to low-cost renewable energy, could narrow the gap and lead to largely fixed power bills,” Gandolfi writes. 

Altogether, electrification is at the core of Draghi's plan. His analysis envisions approximately €3–€4 trillion in spending on electrification and energy transition over 10 years, or about a quarter of eurozone GDP. Goldman Sachs Research expects this to drive a capital expenditure supercycle in electrification infrastructure. 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

How Clearlake Capital's José E. Feliciano finds value across private markets

José  E. Feliciano (R.), Clearlake Capital's co-founder and managing partner, with Michael Brandmeyer, global head and chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management's  External Investing Group, on Goldman Sachs Exchanges 
	
	
	

Despite a subdued dealmaking environment in the private equity industry, Clearlake Capital's José E. Feliciano sees interesting opportunities that the firm can invest in, thanks in part to Clearlake's flexible investment mandate. “We do see a reopening of the capital markets,” Feliciano, co-founder and managing partner of the investment firm, says in a conversation with Goldman Sachs' Michael Brandmeyer on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t31772456,92f7b5da,6571682a Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .  

“We do think that there's going to be very selective opportunities in the buyout side. There's going to be really interesting opportunities in what we call special situations, things like carve-outs, turnarounds. And we do see idiosyncratic, distressed, or special situations where there are really interesting opportunities to buy companies or [access] those companies through debt or restructurings.” 

In particular, Feliciano sees opportunities to invest in the large proprietary datasets that are powering generative artificial intelligence. “The best example is probably within healthcare IT, where big datasets are generated,” he says. “That dataset is extremely important for that machine to learn and potentially translate to better outcomes, better predictability of outcomes, better forecasting, and hopefully in the case of healthcare, better treatment...So we think that AI ultimately will be a force for good.”
