What's next for the boom in AI infrastructure? 	
	
	

	

Growing investment in data centers and hardware for AI technology will provide a boost to US corporate spending next year, according to   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ed8 forecasts by Goldman Sachs Research . 

Our analysts' proprietary tracker for investment into AI uses information on data center construction spending from the Census Bureau as well as technology company sales of data center hardware to monitor real (inflation-adjusted) spending on AI. 

	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ed9 
	

	

Spending on data centers and hardware soared in 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT, Goldman Sachs Research analyst Elsie Peng writes in the team's report. Since then, it has continued to grow at a strong pace, reaching $45 billion in the third quarter of 2024. 

The team expects corporate spending on AI infrastructure to continue to grow next year, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in 2024.

More broadly, US capital expenditure declined on net over the past two quarters once a rebound in airplane production has been taken into account. But Goldman Sachs Research projects that capital spending will rebound to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2025 from a year earlier, supported by continued AI investments, which could add half a percentage point to US capex growth. Lower interest rates, improved business sentiment, and reinstatements of tax incentives are also set to drive an increase in capital expenditure.

China's stimulus may partially offset US tariffs in 2025 	
	
	

	

	

China's economy is projected by  Goldman Sachs Research  to grow at a slower pace in 2025, as the government's stimulus efforts partially offset the impact of potential tariffs from the US. 

Real GDP growth is   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719edc predicted to decelerate  to 4.5% next year from 4.9% in 2024. Goldman Sachs Research's forecast assumes a 20 percentage-point increase in the effective tariff rate imposed by the incoming Trump administration on Chinese goods, which would weigh on China's real GDP by 0.7 percentage point in 2025. The forecast also assumes that Chinese policymakers will introduce fresh stimulus to blunt the impact of tariffs. 
	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719edd 
	

“The choice in front of Chinese policymakers is simple: either to provide a large dose of policy offset or to accept a notably lower headline real GDP growth,” Chief China Economist Hui Shan writes in the team's report. “We expect them to choose the former.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Should investors worry about market concentration?  	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ede 
	

Just a handful of technology stocks — the so-called Magnificent 7 — have driven the S&P 500's strong returns this year. These stocks also account for an outsized share of the index's market cap. So, just how anomalous is the level of US equity market concentration today, and how worried should investors be about it?      

Goldman Sachs Research's David Kostin, chief US equity strategist, says the S&P 500 as unusually concentrated. He says that investors don't need to worry about this high concentration over the short term, arguing that no relationship exists between concentration and near-term returns. 

But over the longer term, say 10 years, investors do need to worry about market concentration, Kostin says in an interview with   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719edf Goldman Sachs  Exchanges  host Allison Nathan as part of Goldman Sachs Research's   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee0 Top of Mind report . “The high level of concentration today would suggest that the returns going forward are likely to be lower than they might have otherwise been if you had a low concentration market,” he says. “A high concentration market is typically associated with a lower return going forward.” 

Acadian Asset Management's Owen Lamont, senior vice president and portfolio manager, says that current concerns over high market concentration are overblown. “It's a fact that concentration has gone up in recent years, but it's not an alarming fact,” he says. “Today's high stock market concentration is mainly just a mechanical function or mechanical byproduct of the fact that mega cap growth firms have had incredibly high profit growth in the last 10 years.”

Why the great gold rally could continue 	
	
	

	

Gold's rally could extend through 2025 on the back of falling rates and persistent central bank demand. 

"Since 2022, gold prices have surged 40% even as US interest rates were climbing,”   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee2 says Lina Thomas , a Goldman Sachs Research commodities strategist. “That is very strange. Typically, higher interest rates make gold less attractive  — because gold doesn't pay any interest, unlike bonds.” 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee3 
	

However, this relationship changed dramatically in early 2022. Thomas notes that this is when the US and other Western countries reacted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by freezing Russia's central bank assets. 

“That was a wake-up call for central banks worldwide,” Thomas says. “They began to diversify their reserves away from the dollar and into an asset no one can freeze — and that is gold.”  

So even as investors sought out higher yields elsewhere, central bank buying buoyed gold. 

“We don't see central bank demand slowing down,” Thomas says. “And with the Federal Reserve cutting rates, investors are jumping back in, too.”  As a result, Thomas forecasts that gold will rise to $3,000 per troy ounce by the end of 2025. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Why Soros Fund Management is focused on the climate transition

For Soros Fund Management, the climate transition is both an investment opportunity and a megatrend aligned with its ambitions. Prior to the AI boom, the demand for electricity hadn't significantly risen in 20 years, Dawn Fitzpatrick, the CEO and CIO of Soros Fund Management, says  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee5 in an edition of Goldman Sachs Talks . Now, however, “power demand is exploding.” 

Fitzpatrick sees “opportunities behind the meter”: consumer and industrial power that doesn't come from a utility. “Battery technology has gotten better very quickly, and cheaper, and the same thing with solar,” she says. “Your break-evens on these projects are coming down at a really interesting rate.” 

As a result, Soros is “investing heavily” in this area, Fitzpatrick says. The climate transition also complements the fund's focus on aligning its values with those of the Open Society Foundations, a grantmaking network established by the investor George Soros. Soros Fund Management is the principal asset manager for the Open Society Foundations, which gives away between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion a year. 

Fitzpatrick also identifies the “gigantic” potential in therapeutics and pharmaceuticals, partly due to the success of anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs. “When you think about human health [and] the knock-ons, or productivity — I mean, there are so many positives…that really, really get us excited,” she says.

What's next for the boom in AI infrastructure? 	
	
	

	

Growing investment in data centers and hardware for AI technology will provide a boost to US corporate spending next year, according to   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ed8 forecasts by Goldman Sachs Research . 

Our analysts' proprietary tracker for investment into AI uses information on data center construction spending from the Census Bureau as well as technology company sales of data center hardware to monitor real (inflation-adjusted) spending on AI. 

	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ed9 
	

	

Spending on data centers and hardware soared in 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT, Goldman Sachs Research analyst Elsie Peng writes in the team's report. Since then, it has continued to grow at a strong pace, reaching $45 billion in the third quarter of 2024. 

The team expects corporate spending on AI infrastructure to continue to grow next year, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in 2024.

More broadly, US capital expenditure declined on net over the past two quarters once a rebound in airplane production has been taken into account. But Goldman Sachs Research projects that capital spending will rebound to 5% in the fourth quarter of 2025 from a year earlier, supported by continued AI investments, which could add half a percentage point to US capex growth. Lower interest rates, improved business sentiment, and reinstatements of tax incentives are also set to drive an increase in capital expenditure.

China's stimulus may partially offset US tariffs in 2025 	
	
	

	

	

China's economy is projected by  Goldman Sachs Research  to grow at a slower pace in 2025, as the government's stimulus efforts partially offset the impact of potential tariffs from the US. 

Real GDP growth is   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719edc predicted to decelerate  to 4.5% next year from 4.9% in 2024. Goldman Sachs Research's forecast assumes a 20 percentage-point increase in the effective tariff rate imposed by the incoming Trump administration on Chinese goods, which would weigh on China's real GDP by 0.7 percentage point in 2025. The forecast also assumes that Chinese policymakers will introduce fresh stimulus to blunt the impact of tariffs. 
	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719edd 
	

“The choice in front of Chinese policymakers is simple: either to provide a large dose of policy offset or to accept a notably lower headline real GDP growth,” Chief China Economist Hui Shan writes in the team's report. “We expect them to choose the former.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Should investors worry about market concentration?  	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ede 
	

Just a handful of technology stocks — the so-called Magnificent 7 — have driven the S&P 500's strong returns this year. These stocks also account for an outsized share of the index's market cap. So, just how anomalous is the level of US equity market concentration today, and how worried should investors be about it?      

Goldman Sachs Research's David Kostin, chief US equity strategist, says the S&P 500 as unusually concentrated. He says that investors don't need to worry about this high concentration over the short term, arguing that no relationship exists between concentration and near-term returns. 

But over the longer term, say 10 years, investors do need to worry about market concentration, Kostin says in an interview with   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719edf Goldman Sachs  Exchanges  host Allison Nathan as part of Goldman Sachs Research's   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee0 Top of Mind report . “The high level of concentration today would suggest that the returns going forward are likely to be lower than they might have otherwise been if you had a low concentration market,” he says. “A high concentration market is typically associated with a lower return going forward.” 

Acadian Asset Management's Owen Lamont, senior vice president and portfolio manager, says that current concerns over high market concentration are overblown. “It's a fact that concentration has gone up in recent years, but it's not an alarming fact,” he says. “Today's high stock market concentration is mainly just a mechanical function or mechanical byproduct of the fact that mega cap growth firms have had incredibly high profit growth in the last 10 years.”

Why the great gold rally could continue 	
	
	

	

Gold's rally could extend through 2025 on the back of falling rates and persistent central bank demand. 

"Since 2022, gold prices have surged 40% even as US interest rates were climbing,”   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee2 says Lina Thomas , a Goldman Sachs Research commodities strategist. “That is very strange. Typically, higher interest rates make gold less attractive  — because gold doesn't pay any interest, unlike bonds.” 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee3 
	

However, this relationship changed dramatically in early 2022. Thomas notes that this is when the US and other Western countries reacted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine by freezing Russia's central bank assets. 

“That was a wake-up call for central banks worldwide,” Thomas says. “They began to diversify their reserves away from the dollar and into an asset no one can freeze — and that is gold.”  

So even as investors sought out higher yields elsewhere, central bank buying buoyed gold. 

“We don't see central bank demand slowing down,” Thomas says. “And with the Federal Reserve cutting rates, investors are jumping back in, too.”  As a result, Thomas forecasts that gold will rise to $3,000 per troy ounce by the end of 2025. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Why Soros Fund Management is focused on the climate transition

For Soros Fund Management, the climate transition is both an investment opportunity and a megatrend aligned with its ambitions. Prior to the AI boom, the demand for electricity hadn't significantly risen in 20 years, Dawn Fitzpatrick, the CEO and CIO of Soros Fund Management, says  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t320f703b,934c38b2,65719ee5 in an edition of Goldman Sachs Talks . Now, however, “power demand is exploding.” 

Fitzpatrick sees “opportunities behind the meter”: consumer and industrial power that doesn't come from a utility. “Battery technology has gotten better very quickly, and cheaper, and the same thing with solar,” she says. “Your break-evens on these projects are coming down at a really interesting rate.” 

As a result, Soros is “investing heavily” in this area, Fitzpatrick says. The climate transition also complements the fund's focus on aligning its values with those of the Open Society Foundations, a grantmaking network established by the investor George Soros. Soros Fund Management is the principal asset manager for the Open Society Foundations, which gives away between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion a year. 

Fitzpatrick also identifies the “gigantic” potential in therapeutics and pharmaceuticals, partly due to the success of anti-obesity GLP-1 drugs. “When you think about human health [and] the knock-ons, or productivity — I mean, there are so many positives…that really, really get us excited,” she says.
