Tariffs are expected to weaken the dollar 	
	
	

	

Changes in US trade policy are having a significant impact on the country's currency, according to Goldman Sachs Research. 

The increase in trade tensions and other uncertainty-raising policies are eroding consumer and business confidence, Michael Cahill, Goldman Sachs Research's senior currency strategist, writes in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8be his  team's report . The team finds that changing perceptions of US governance and institutions are also affecting the appeal of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8bf US assets  for foreign investors, and the rapid back-and-forth on policy decisions makes it difficult for investors to price outcomes other than high uncertainty.

Goldman Sachs Research anticipates the US dollar's weakness against its major peers during the first quarter of 2025 will persist. 

“We have previously argued that the US's exceptional return prospects are responsible for the dollar's strong valuation,” Cahill writes. “But if tariffs weigh on US firms' profit margins and US consumers' real incomes, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar.” 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	
	
	

	

How resilient is private credit in a downturn?

The rise of private credit has become one of the biggest stories in global financial markets and has led to significant changes in the ways investors allocate their portfolios and how companies raise money. But as a relatively young asset class — representing an estimated $2.1 trillion in assets under management today — investors are watching closely to see how private credit performs in a full-blown recession or cyclical downturn.  

In the latest episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c2 Goldman Sachs Exchanges , James Reynolds, global co-head of private credit in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist and head of credit, mortgages, and structured products research for Goldman Sachs Research, make the case that private credit remains relatively insulated from the current market volatility. 

Karoui highlights that private credit is actually more defensive in composition than many parts of the public market, and it offers greater flexibility for navigating financial distress. The lack of a commonly tracked benchmark on the private side also suggests we'd see greater dispersion in losses and manager performance in a recessionary scenario. “From the perspective of a capital allocator…that makes manager selection a far more important ingredient than on the public side,” Karoui says.  

Investors are also turning to private credit as an inflation hedge. “At a moment of volatility like we're seeing today or [as] we saw in 2022, 2023 or during C ovid, I would say our investors…see credit as being very defensive,” Reynolds says. “And they see private credit as being a good hedge against potential inflation as well, given that most of what we do when we lend to a borrower is exposed to a floating rate.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Staying the course with US equities 	
	
	

	

Goldman Sachs' Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) sees several   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c3 reasons to stay invested  in US equities. While recession risks have risen, the stock market appears to have already embedded a significant risk premium for recession. In a typical recession, equities fall 30%. When the S&P 500 suffered a 21% peak-to-intraday low decline in 2025, investors appeared to be ascribing 60-70% odds to a recession. While the risk of recession has clearly risen, it is not ISG's base case. The elevated recession odds already reflected in market pricing lower the hurdle for positive surprises — both on the trade front and in broader economic data. 

In addition, past periods of high uncertainty did not persist indefinitely. Historically, receding uncertainty has supported strong US equity returns. In fact, the S&P 500's average gain in the year following these periods exceeded 20% — twice the long-term average — and was positive in eight out of ten episodes. 
	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c4 
	

	

To be clear, these supportive factors do not rule out further downdrafts in the stock market as investors derisk or if fundamentals devolve in a way that validates investors' current recession fears. That said, given the already bearish sentiment and positioning among investors, even modest improvements can drive large gains — as seen on April 9, for example, following the announcement of a 90-day pause on the proposed tariffs for non-retaliating countries. ISG maintains that clients with a strategic allocation that appropriately reflects their risk tolerance should remain invested, while those building exposure may want to use the current downdraft as an opportunity to deploy capital. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Shell's CEO on the outlook for energy 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

For more than 60 years, Shell has developed scenarios to project how the global energy system will change. The energy and petrochemical company's most recent analysis considers a range of situations, from a transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to a continued increase in global fragmentation because of trade barriers and a focus on energy security. 

“What are the key elements common across all those scenarios? The biggest thing...is that energy demand is going to grow between now and 2050,” Wael Sawan, the CEO of Shell, said on March 26 in a discussion with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 

Among fossil fuels, liquified natural gas (LNG) will be the fastest-growing sector, Sawan said. Shell projects that the market for natural gas will increase by 1% annually through 2040, while LNG will rise 3% or more during that span, resulting in growth of 60% in the next 15 years. 

LNG has typically been important for heavy industry and, to some extent, power generation. Going forward, it has the potential to help supplement renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which are intermittent and not always able to produce electricity, Sawan said. It also has an important role as a replacement for coal, particularly in Asia, for heavy industry. Today LNG represents around 13% of overall gas sales around the world, and Sawan said he expects it to increase to about 20% by 2040.  

“The key demand center is Asia, by far,” he said. Sawan expects India and China to increase the share of LNG in their power supplies. “That moves mountains in terms of volumes,” he added. 

Oil, meanwhile, will be a core part of the energy transition, Sawan noted: Even in the most bullish scenario for reaching net-zero carbon emissions, oil demand will decrease only slightly from today's level. Given that oil field production declines at a rate of about 5% per year, “you need to be running very fast just to stay flat,” Sawan said. That means the industry will need to bring about “a significant amount of new production.” 

Sawan said he expects electrification to be one of the fastest-growing parts of the global energy system. Some of that electricity will come from renewable sources like solar and wind, but also from natural gas and nuclear power.

Why global insurers are turning towards private assets 	
	
	

	

The global insurance industry is rotating towards more diversified and illiquid investment portfolios, according to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c5 Goldman Sachs Asset Management's 14 th  Global Insurance Survey . 

The survey, which polled 405 respondents representing more than $14 trillion in insurance balance sheet assets, revealed that 62% of insurers are planning to increase their allocations to private assets over the next year. Among these, private credit stands out, with 61% of respondents ranking it among the top five asset classes expected to have the highest total return over the next 12 months. 

This growing confidence in private assets comes as insurers increasingly believe that credit quality has stabilized. Nearly a third of insurers are prepared to take on more credit risk. “As the market expands, more financing opportunities may arise, providing attractive returns for insurance companies while diversifying their direct lending portfolios,” says Stephanie Rader, global co-head of alternatives capital formation at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c6 
	

	

Private assets also offer insurers a more diverse portfolio at a time of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and in a shifting geopolitical landscape. Insurers are concerned with the potential impact inflation may have on their portfolios, with 52% citing it as the greatest macroeconomic risk to their investments, an increase from 42% in 2024.

The rise of private credit has become one of the biggest stories in global financial markets and has led to significant changes in the ways investors allocate their portfolios and how companies raise money. But as a relatively young asset class — representing an estimated $2.1 trillion in assets under management today — investors are watching closely to see how private credit performs in a full-blown recession or cyclical downturn.

Goldman Sachs' Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) sees several   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c3 reasons to stay invested  in US equities.

For more than 60 years, Shell has developed scenarios to project how the global energy system will change. The energy and petrochemical company's most recent analysis considers a range of situations, from a transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to a continued increase in global fragmentation because of trade barriers and a focus on energy security.

Tariffs are expected to weaken the dollar 	
	
	

	

Changes in US trade policy are having a significant impact on the country's currency, according to Goldman Sachs Research. 

The increase in trade tensions and other uncertainty-raising policies are eroding consumer and business confidence, Michael Cahill, Goldman Sachs Research's senior currency strategist, writes in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8be his  team's report . The team finds that changing perceptions of US governance and institutions are also affecting the appeal of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8bf US assets  for foreign investors, and the rapid back-and-forth on policy decisions makes it difficult for investors to price outcomes other than high uncertainty. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c0 
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research anticipates the US dollar's weakness against its major peers during the first quarter of 2025 will persist. 

“We have previously argued that the US's exceptional return prospects are responsible for the dollar's strong valuation,” Cahill writes. “But if tariffs weigh on US firms' profit margins and US consumers' real incomes, they can erode that exceptionalism and, in turn, crack the central pillar of the strong dollar.” 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	
	
	

	

How resilient is private credit in a downturn?

The rise of private credit has become one of the biggest stories in global financial markets and has led to significant changes in the ways investors allocate their portfolios and how companies raise money. But as a relatively young asset class — representing an estimated $2.1 trillion in assets under management today — investors are watching closely to see how private credit performs in a full-blown recession or cyclical downturn.  

In the latest episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c2 Goldman Sachs Exchanges , James Reynolds, global co-head of private credit in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and Lotfi Karoui, chief credit strategist and head of credit, mortgages, and structured products research for Goldman Sachs Research, make the case that private credit remains relatively insulated from the current market volatility. 

Karoui highlights that private credit is actually more defensive in composition than many parts of the public market, and it offers greater flexibility for navigating financial distress. The lack of a commonly tracked benchmark on the private side also suggests we'd see greater dispersion in losses and manager performance in a recessionary scenario. “From the perspective of a capital allocator…that makes manager selection a far more important ingredient than on the public side,” Karoui says.  

Investors are also turning to private credit as an inflation hedge. “At a moment of volatility like we're seeing today or [as] we saw in 2022, 2023 or during C ovid, I would say our investors…see credit as being very defensive,” Reynolds says. “And they see private credit as being a good hedge against potential inflation as well, given that most of what we do when we lend to a borrower is exposed to a floating rate.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Staying the course with US equities 	
	
	

	

Goldman Sachs' Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) sees several   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c3 reasons to stay invested  in US equities. While recession risks have risen, the stock market appears to have already embedded a significant risk premium for recession. In a typical recession, equities fall 30%. When the S&P 500 suffered a 21% peak-to-intraday low decline in 2025, investors appeared to be ascribing 60-70% odds to a recession. While the risk of recession has clearly risen, it is not ISG's base case. The elevated recession odds already reflected in market pricing lower the hurdle for positive surprises — both on the trade front and in broader economic data. 

In addition, past periods of high uncertainty did not persist indefinitely. Historically, receding uncertainty has supported strong US equity returns. In fact, the S&P 500's average gain in the year following these periods exceeded 20% — twice the long-term average — and was positive in eight out of ten episodes. 
	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c4 
	

	

To be clear, these supportive factors do not rule out further downdrafts in the stock market as investors derisk or if fundamentals devolve in a way that validates investors' current recession fears. That said, given the already bearish sentiment and positioning among investors, even modest improvements can drive large gains — as seen on April 9, for example, following the announcement of a 90-day pause on the proposed tariffs for non-retaliating countries. ISG maintains that clients with a strategic allocation that appropriately reflects their risk tolerance should remain invested, while those building exposure may want to use the current downdraft as an opportunity to deploy capital. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Shell's CEO on the outlook for energy 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

For more than 60 years, Shell has developed scenarios to project how the global energy system will change. The energy and petrochemical company's most recent analysis considers a range of situations, from a transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to a continued increase in global fragmentation because of trade barriers and a focus on energy security. 

“What are the key elements common across all those scenarios? The biggest thing...is that energy demand is going to grow between now and 2050,” Wael Sawan, the CEO of Shell, said on March 26 in a discussion with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 

Among fossil fuels, liquified natural gas (LNG) will be the fastest-growing sector, Sawan said. Shell projects that the market for natural gas will increase by 1% annually through 2040, while LNG will rise 3% or more during that span, resulting in growth of 60% in the next 15 years. 

LNG has typically been important for heavy industry and, to some extent, power generation. Going forward, it has the potential to help supplement renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which are intermittent and not always able to produce electricity, Sawan said. It also has an important role as a replacement for coal, particularly in Asia, for heavy industry. Today LNG represents around 13% of overall gas sales around the world, and Sawan said he expects it to increase to about 20% by 2040.  

“The key demand center is Asia, by far,” he said. Sawan expects India and China to increase the share of LNG in their power supplies. “That moves mountains in terms of volumes,” he added. 

Oil, meanwhile, will be a core part of the energy transition, Sawan noted: Even in the most bullish scenario for reaching net-zero carbon emissions, oil demand will decrease only slightly from today's level. Given that oil field production declines at a rate of about 5% per year, “you need to be running very fast just to stay flat,” Sawan said. That means the industry will need to bring about “a significant amount of new production.” 

Sawan said he expects electrification to be one of the fastest-growing parts of the global energy system. Some of that electricity will come from renewable sources like solar and wind, but also from natural gas and nuclear power.

Why global insurers are turning towards private assets 	
	
	

	

The global insurance industry is rotating towards more diversified and illiquid investment portfolios, according to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c5 Goldman Sachs Asset Management's 14 th  Global Insurance Survey . 

The survey, which polled 405 respondents representing more than $14 trillion in insurance balance sheet assets, revealed that 62% of insurers are planning to increase their allocations to private assets over the next year. Among these, private credit stands out, with 61% of respondents ranking it among the top five asset classes expected to have the highest total return over the next 12 months. 

This growing confidence in private assets comes as insurers increasingly believe that credit quality has stabilized. Nearly a third of insurers are prepared to take on more credit risk. “As the market expands, more financing opportunities may arise, providing attractive returns for insurance companies while diversifying their direct lending portfolios,” says Stephanie Rader, global co-head of alternatives capital formation at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36235ae9,989ffd6e,6575a8c6 
	

	

Private assets also offer insurers a more diverse portfolio at a time of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and in a shifting geopolitical landscape. Insurers are concerned with the potential impact inflation may have on their portfolios, with 52% citing it as the greatest macroeconomic risk to their investments, an increase from 42% in 2024.
