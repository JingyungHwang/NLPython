The outlook for private credit 	
	
	

Are there still opportunities in private credit? The asset class has more doubled in size since 2018, with about a trillion dollars entering private credit strategies.   
	
	
	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2dad5b26,8cc886fc,656cb4b1 

Some have raised concerns that the space may be getting crowded, with too much money chasing too few opportunities. But   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2dad5b26,8cc886fc,656cb4b2 Stephanie Rader of Goldman Sachs Asset Management  points out that “it's important to keep the context in mind.” 

She explains that “private credit is filling a void left by the banks, which have pulled back on lending in light of post-financial crisis regulations.” 

And while the asset class is popular among investors because of its potential to deliver high returns and diversification, Rader adds that it's increasingly sought out by borrowers who “see the benefits of this bilateral relationship with a private credit lender — including speed, flexibility, and certainty of execution.” 

“We still think there are big opportunities in private credit,” Rader concludes. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Can the US rally continue?   	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2dad5b26,8cc886fc,656cb4b3 
	

	

US equities have staged a remarkable rally through the first half of this year, largely buoyed by investor excitement over the five large-cap tech stocks mostly closely associated with artificial intelligence.    
    
While the earnings of these companies — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — have supported the higher stock prices, investors are now shifting their focus to when the companies' AI investments will translate into real revenue gains and earnings contributions, David Kostin, Goldman Sachs'  chief US equity strategist, says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2dad5b26,8cc886fc,656cb4b4 Goldman Sachs Exchanges .    
    
“Portfolio managers had been really embracing the euphoria, the excitement about AI, and what that might mean for corporate profitability, business activity, [and] productivity in the economy,” Kostin tells host Allison Nathan. “More recently, that has shifted, and there's much more questioning of managements — whether or not they can actually deliver better financial results as a consequence of all this investment that's taking place.”    
    
For now, Kostin believes that the US equity market is fairly valued, and that the trajectory of the market looks to be in line with the trajectory of earnings.

$1,000,000,000,000 
	
	
	

The estimated capital expenditure by tech giants, other companies, and utilities in coming years on the artificial intelligence revolution. This $1 trillion spend includes significant investments in data centers, chips, other AI infrastructure, and the power grid. Is that too much spending for too little benefit?

Jennison's Kathleen McCarragher on finding the largest stocks powering markets today

Jennison Associates' Kathleen McCarragher and her team have been early investors in many of the largest stocks powering markets higher today. That success — investing in Nvidia in 2016, for example — stems from the depth of research and the long-standing experience of her investors, McCarragher says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2dad5b26,8cc886fc,656cb4b7 Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .    
    
A decades-long large-cap growth investor, McCarragher says she and her team have also prolonged their average investment periods in large-cap growth stocks, as these companies build up the sustainability of their business models, McCarragher says. “Some of these companies have scaled globally, and they have meaningful market opportunities. At some point, maturation or the law of large numbers will set in, and growth will slow. But right now, the competitive barriers and dominant industry positions allow them to continue to grow at really attractive rates.”    
    
And while artificial intelligence is clearly benefiting big tech companies, it will also enhance growth rates, productivity, and returns across other large-cap sectors, she says. “When you go beyond technology, we start to talk about productivity gains,” McCarragher says. “The way we believe we will see them first is skill sets that can be enhanced rather than headcount reductions. Over time, what we will find is that as these technologies move into other industries — whether it's healthcare, whether it's education, whether it's oil and gas — we expect to see real foundational capabilities emerge out of utilizing this technology.”

The estimated capital expenditure by tech giants, other companies, and utilities in coming years on the artificial intelligence revolution. This $1 trillion spend includes significant investments in data centers, chips, other AI infrastructure, and the power grid. Is that too much spending for too little benefit?

Jennison Associates' Kathleen McCarragher and her team have been early investors in many of the largest stocks powering markets higher today. That success — investing in Nvidia in 2016, for example — stems from the depth of research and the long-standing experience of her investors, McCarragher says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2dad5b26,8cc886fc,656cb4b7 Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .    
    
A decades-long large-cap growth investor, McCarragher says she and her team have also prolonged their average investment periods in large-cap growth stocks, as these companies build up the sustainability of their business models, McCarragher says. “Some of these companies have scaled globally, and they have meaningful market opportunities. At some point, maturation or the law of large numbers will set in, and growth will slow. But right now, the competitive barriers and dominant industry positions allow them to continue to grow at really attractive rates.”    
    
And while artificial intelligence is clearly benefiting big tech companies, it will also enhance growth rates, productivity, and returns across other large-cap sectors, she says. “When you go beyond technology, we start to talk about productivity gains,” McCarragher says. “The way we believe we will see them first is skill sets that can be enhanced rather than headcount reductions. Over time, what we will find is that as these technologies move into other industries — whether it's healthcare, whether it's education, whether it's oil and gas — we expect to see real foundational capabilities emerge out of utilizing this technology.”
