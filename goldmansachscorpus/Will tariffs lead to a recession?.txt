Will tariffs lead to a recession? 	
	
	

	

	

The Trump administration's tariffs have upended decades of US trade policy, sparking a rapid reassessment of the economic outlook in the US and beyond. Goldman Sachs Research's  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6ee Top of Mind report  examines what lies ahead for the US economy amid this radical shift in trade policy. 

Paul Krugman, the Nobel-winning economist, explains that the size and speed of the rise in tariff rates makes this “the biggest trade shock in history.” But he's more concerned about the uncertainty created by the trade policy shift than the scale of the shift itself when it comes to US recession risk. Even high tariffs don't normally cause recessions, he says, but unpredictable tariffs that leave businesses hesitant to make long-term investment decisions very well might. As a result, Krugman says “a recession seems likely,” and argues that policy reversals may actually hurt rather than help, given that the reversals themselves may be reversed at a moment's notice, which only increases uncertainty.

Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs Research's chief economist, also expects a sizable tariff-induced hit to US GDP growth owing to reduced business investment, the tax-like effect of tariff increases on real income and consumer spending, and tighter financial conditions as markets price a dimmer outlook. He forecasts low US growth and a 45% chance of recession within the next year, assuming the full slate of the “Liberation Day” tariffs won't take effect. Goldman Sachs Research would probably shift to a recession call, he says, if they do take effect. That said, Hatzius is more optimistic than Krugman that a policy reversal could stabilize near-term conditions. 

Oren Cass, founder of American Compass, argues that although the Trump administration's goal of reordering the global trade system will entail some short-term costs, “there is no reason the trade policies the administration is pursuing would need to cause a recession.” In his view, while the abruptness and lack of communication around the implementation of the shifts in tariff policy were understandably frustrating, the administration has already taken helpful steps to course correct, which should continue to resolve any uncertainty. And, Cass says, companies already have enough information about the administration's tariff goals to work out the right strategy: Invest significantly more in US-based production.

Why the euro is strengthening 	
	
	

	

A   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f1 global repricing of asset s  in the light of tariffs and lower US growth expectations is helping to strengthen the euro versus the US dollar, according to Goldman Sachs Research. With policy shifts and uncertainty potentially weighing on American firms' profits and households' real incomes, investors, particularly those in Europe, appear to be revising their expectation of superior returns from US assets, which is in turn eroding the strong valuation the dollar has enjoyed over the last decade.  

“In many ways, the euro is on the other side of this story,” writes Kamakshya Trivedi, head of Global Foreign Exchange, Interest Rates, and Emerging Markets Strategy Research, in a recent note. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

Investors based in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f2 Europe  — with substantial savings and high ownership of overseas assets — have been the biggest source of increased allocations to US assets in recent years.  

With the superior return profile of US assets now looking less certain   given increased recession risks, “European investors may decide that the additional foreign exchange risk is no longer appealing when taking into consideration lower expected returns in US equity markets,” Trivedi writes.  

This is in line with early indicators from fund flow data suggesting investors are allocating less money to the US, although Trivedi cautions that any continued weakness in the dollar is more likely to show up through a gradual shift in demand, not a disruptive sale of US assets.

As  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f5 artificial intelligence  models grow more advanced, the industry is “spending like crazy” on building out the underlying infrastructure,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f6 says Sarah Friar , the chief financial officer of OpenAI. “We all need more compute,” she says, referring to the chips, data centers, and other equipment that drive AI models.  

Speaking at Goldman Sachs' Disruptive Technology Symposium in London, Friar outlines the progress she envisions for AI models, en route to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f7 artificial general intelligence  (AGI), as well as the kinds of investment and infrastructure required to give the US an edge in the AI race. 

In January, a consortium that includes OpenAI announced a plan to invest $500 billion by 2029 to build around 10 gigawatts worth of data centers —  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f8 a power consumption load  greater than the residential power consumption in Ireland. “We have to find sites, find power, dig holes in ground, put up data centers, fill them with equipment, buy GPUs [chips], and prove we can do this," Friar says. 

What feels like an ambitious $500 billion investment today will soon be seen as just the beginning, Friar says. She adds that there is now a generational opportunity to rebuild critical infrastructure — cleaner, smarter, and at global scale. 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Are US Treasuries past the point of peak concern? 	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f9 
	

US   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6fa Treasuries responded unusually  when changes in US tariff policy caused financial market stress to jump. The world's reserve asset, which is traditionally seen as a haven at times of market turmoil, declined in early April. 

William Marshall, head of US rates strategy in Goldman Sachs Research, points to three main factors that could help explain the weakness in the price of Treasuries: 

Concerns about the path of the US economy . Growing trade tensions complicate the case for owning Treasuries as a hedge against volatility, given the possibility that tariffs could drive down growth while boosting inflation, Marshall points out. 

“Growth and inflation moving in opposite directions erodes some of that hedging property, which makes things a little bit more complicated. So if you're a multi-asset investor thinking about Treasuries in a portfolio context, their value is perhaps a little bit less clear cut,” Marshall says. 

A reassessment of the implications of tariffs for US debt . At the same time, the market's focus on the implications of tariffs for US borrowing has shifted in recent weeks from an emphasis on how much money tariffs could raise in revenue to concerns about the prospect of a downturn, which could lead to higher government borrowing due to lower tax receipts and increased spending needs. 

Are investors re-allocating away from dollar assets?  It's not evident to Marshall that the   recent price action reflects that dynamic. “We would not rule out a diversification away from dollar assets over time, but the near-term behavior appears more consistent with some anticipatory concern about that possibility in conjunction with unwinds of levered longs,” he notes, referring to trades using borrowed money that are positioned for assets to climb. 

Marshall says the Treasury market may be past the local point of greatest concern, and the 90-day delay in tariff implementation allays concerns of a more severe tariff scenario in the near term. But he adds that all three factors could remain drivers of uncertainty in the market for some time to come.

Despite the ongoing market tumult, Warburg Pincus CEO Jeffrey Perlman says he's excited about the long-term investment opportunities in Asia and in artificial intelligence.  

“Everyone is going to be caught up in the tariffs of the moment” and people will always be focused on the problem in front of them, Perlman says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6fc Goldman Sachs Exchanges : Great Investors . “One of the great strengths you have to have is to see above the trees,” he says. While tariffs will have a near-term impact on global supply chains, two-thirds of global growth is expected to come from Asia, he tells Goldman Sachs' Alison Mass, chairman of investment banking. Rising populations across Asia should further boost consumption and growth, especially as households become more affluent, he says.  

AI, meanwhile, is likely to have an even greater impact on portfolio companies' revenue, expenses, and cost optimization, he adds. “Certainly, [AI] can be as much a threat as it is an asset, but I think when we look at it, there's just huge opportunities.”

Will tariffs lead to a recession? 	
	
	

	

	

The Trump administration's tariffs have upended decades of US trade policy, sparking a rapid reassessment of the economic outlook in the US and beyond. Goldman Sachs Research's  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6ee Top of Mind report  examines what lies ahead for the US economy amid this radical shift in trade policy. 

Paul Krugman, the Nobel-winning economist, explains that the size and speed of the rise in tariff rates makes this “the biggest trade shock in history.” But he's more concerned about the uncertainty created by the trade policy shift than the scale of the shift itself when it comes to US recession risk. Even high tariffs don't normally cause recessions, he says, but unpredictable tariffs that leave businesses hesitant to make long-term investment decisions very well might. As a result, Krugman says “a recession seems likely,” and argues that policy reversals may actually hurt rather than help, given that the reversals themselves may be reversed at a moment's notice, which only increases uncertainty.

Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs Research's chief economist, also expects a sizable tariff-induced hit to US GDP growth owing to reduced business investment, the tax-like effect of tariff increases on real income and consumer spending, and tighter financial conditions as markets price a dimmer outlook. He forecasts low US growth and a 45% chance of recession within the next year, assuming the full slate of the “Liberation Day” tariffs won't take effect. Goldman Sachs Research would probably shift to a recession call, he says, if they do take effect. That said, Hatzius is more optimistic than Krugman that a policy reversal could stabilize near-term conditions. 

Oren Cass, founder of American Compass, argues that although the Trump administration's goal of reordering the global trade system will entail some short-term costs, “there is no reason the trade policies the administration is pursuing would need to cause a recession.” In his view, while the abruptness and lack of communication around the implementation of the shifts in tariff policy were understandably frustrating, the administration has already taken helpful steps to course correct, which should continue to resolve any uncertainty. And, Cass says, companies already have enough information about the administration's tariff goals to work out the right strategy: Invest significantly more in US-based production.

Why the euro is strengthening 	
	
	

	

A   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f1 global repricing of asset s  in the light of tariffs and lower US growth expectations is helping to strengthen the euro versus the US dollar, according to Goldman Sachs Research. With policy shifts and uncertainty potentially weighing on American firms' profits and households' real incomes, investors, particularly those in Europe, appear to be revising their expectation of superior returns from US assets, which is in turn eroding the strong valuation the dollar has enjoyed over the last decade.  

“In many ways, the euro is on the other side of this story,” writes Kamakshya Trivedi, head of Global Foreign Exchange, Interest Rates, and Emerging Markets Strategy Research, in a recent note. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

Investors based in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f2 Europe  — with substantial savings and high ownership of overseas assets — have been the biggest source of increased allocations to US assets in recent years.  

With the superior return profile of US assets now looking less certain   given increased recession risks, “European investors may decide that the additional foreign exchange risk is no longer appealing when taking into consideration lower expected returns in US equity markets,” Trivedi writes.  

This is in line with early indicators from fund flow data suggesting investors are allocating less money to the US, although Trivedi cautions that any continued weakness in the dollar is more likely to show up through a gradual shift in demand, not a disruptive sale of US assets.

OpenAI's Sarah Friar on the investment needed to advance AI

As  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f5 artificial intelligence  models grow more advanced, the industry is “spending like crazy” on building out the underlying infrastructure,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f6 says Sarah Friar , the chief financial officer of OpenAI. “We all need more compute,” she says, referring to the chips, data centers, and other equipment that drive AI models.  

Speaking at Goldman Sachs' Disruptive Technology Symposium in London, Friar outlines the progress she envisions for AI models, en route to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f7 artificial general intelligence  (AGI), as well as the kinds of investment and infrastructure required to give the US an edge in the AI race. 

In January, a consortium that includes OpenAI announced a plan to invest $500 billion by 2029 to build around 10 gigawatts worth of data centers —  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f8 a power consumption load  greater than the residential power consumption in Ireland. “We have to find sites, find power, dig holes in ground, put up data centers, fill them with equipment, buy GPUs [chips], and prove we can do this," Friar says. 

What feels like an ambitious $500 billion investment today will soon be seen as just the beginning, Friar says. She adds that there is now a generational opportunity to rebuild critical infrastructure — cleaner, smarter, and at global scale. 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Are US Treasuries past the point of peak concern? 	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6f9 
	

US   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6fa Treasuries responded unusually  when changes in US tariff policy caused financial market stress to jump. The world's reserve asset, which is traditionally seen as a haven at times of market turmoil, declined in early April. 

William Marshall, head of US rates strategy in Goldman Sachs Research, points to three main factors that could help explain the weakness in the price of Treasuries: 

Concerns about the path of the US economy . Growing trade tensions complicate the case for owning Treasuries as a hedge against volatility, given the possibility that tariffs could drive down growth while boosting inflation, Marshall points out. 

“Growth and inflation moving in opposite directions erodes some of that hedging property, which makes things a little bit more complicated. So if you're a multi-asset investor thinking about Treasuries in a portfolio context, their value is perhaps a little bit less clear cut,” Marshall says. 

A reassessment of the implications of tariffs for US debt . At the same time, the market's focus on the implications of tariffs for US borrowing has shifted in recent weeks from an emphasis on how much money tariffs could raise in revenue to concerns about the prospect of a downturn, which could lead to higher government borrowing due to lower tax receipts and increased spending needs. 

Are investors re-allocating away from dollar assets?  It's not evident to Marshall that the   recent price action reflects that dynamic. “We would not rule out a diversification away from dollar assets over time, but the near-term behavior appears more consistent with some anticipatory concern about that possibility in conjunction with unwinds of levered longs,” he notes, referring to trades using borrowed money that are positioned for assets to climb. 

Marshall says the Treasury market may be past the local point of greatest concern, and the 90-day delay in tariff implementation allays concerns of a more severe tariff scenario in the near term. But he adds that all three factors could remain drivers of uncertainty in the market for some time to come. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Where Warburg Pincus CEO Jeffrey Perlman sees investment opportunities

Warburg Pincus' Jeffrey Perlman (L) with Alison Mass on Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors. 
	
	
	

	

Despite the ongoing market tumult, Warburg Pincus CEO Jeffrey Perlman says he's excited about the long-term investment opportunities in Asia and in artificial intelligence.  

“Everyone is going to be caught up in the tariffs of the moment” and people will always be focused on the problem in front of them, Perlman says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t3640a196,98f15627,6575e6fc Goldman Sachs Exchanges : Great Investors . “One of the great strengths you have to have is to see above the trees,” he says. While tariffs will have a near-term impact on global supply chains, two-thirds of global growth is expected to come from Asia, he tells Goldman Sachs' Alison Mass, chairman of investment banking. Rising populations across Asia should further boost consumption and growth, especially as households become more affluent, he says.  

AI, meanwhile, is likely to have an even greater impact on portfolio companies' revenue, expenses, and cost optimization, he adds. “Certainly, [AI] can be as much a threat as it is an asset, but I think when we look at it, there's just huge opportunities.”
