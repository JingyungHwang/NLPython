Is US outperformance at a turning point? 	
	
	

	

The US has had an exceptional decade. US economic growth and equities have outperformed and the dollar's global role remains unchallenged. But this outperformance has begun to show some cracks with US equities selling off over the past month. 

Rebecca Patterson, former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, believes US equities can continue outperforming over the next decade, led by tech and generative artificial intelligence. “Now that's a big statement because if we go back historically…you will see outperformance roughly for a decade, and then it tends to hand over,” Patterson says on  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658470 Goldman Sachs Exchanges , which breaks down the topic from the latest  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658471 Top of Mind report . “When I think about what could drive the next decade, I go back to tech being a possible catalyst to lead to another decade of US outperformance.” 	
	
	

	

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658472 	
	
	

	

But Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, sees this as more questionable than in the past given several “mega forces” — rather than cyclical performance — are set to drive equity performance. “If we talk about the last 20, 30 years, I think [the US] has been exceptional...but as a forward statement, I think there's more question now. I still think that business conditions that create the possibility for companies to take innovation and develop at scale is still unmatched. But there are other conditions around demographics, around geopolitics, that can now dent this benefit more than they have in the past.” 

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer notes the US equity market is now very concentrated — with its exceptionalism owing to a handful of large companies — and is seeing increased competition from other asset classes in the current high-rate environment. “Investors need to think about diversifying geographically and across different factors and indeed sectors much more in the next decade than they were perhaps used to in the last decade,” he says. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Why electric vehicle battery prices are falling faster than expected 	
	
	

	

Not long ago, rising demand and component shortages sparked concern that “greenflation” would drive up prices for the batteries in electric vehicles.  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658473 That's subsiding as prices cool for battery metals , which could help make EVs more competitive with traditional cars more quickly. 	
	
	

	

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658474 	
	
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research now expects battery prices to fall to $99 per kilowatt hour of storage capacity by 2025 — a 40% decrease from 2022. Our analysts estimate almost half of the decline will come from declining prices of EV raw materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Battery pack prices are now expected to fall by an average of 11% per year from 2023 to 2030, writes Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research's Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, in the team's report. 

As battery prices fall, the EV market is forecast to potentially achieve cost parity, without subsidies, with internal combustion engine vehicles around the middle of this decade on a total-cost-of-ownership basis. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

The global credibility gap: assessing underperformance and overreach in geopolitics

Washington and Wall Street are worried about the same thing: geopolitics. After decades of relative international stability and increasing globalization, businesses and governments are now struggling to understand a new, more unpredictable, and more violent global reality. 

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658476 But today's geopolitical shocks are connected by a great-power credibility crisis between the US and China , which is compounding geopolitical instability and uncertainty, according to an article by Goldman Sachs' Jared Cohen, president of Global Affairs and co-head of the Office of Applied Innovation, and Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group and GZERO Media. The ongoing credibility crisis is changing geopolitics by creating geopolitical  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658477 swing states  and shifting alignments between countries. 

It is also creating space for big technology companies to play a larger role in global politics while widening a global governance deficit. 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Millennial and Gen Z values could change the economy 	
	
	

	

The  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658478 attitudes of young consumers could shift consumer spending , according to Jen Sullivan of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 

Sullivan says that when compared to their predecessors, millennial and Gen Z consumers are more likely to value experiences over physical possessions. Given these generations' rising prominence, “it's no surprise that over the past 20 years, we've seen the share of spending on services rise considerably,” she says. 	
	
	

	

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658479 	
	
	

	

	

As the earning power of these generations continues to grow, Sullivan predicts “services stands to become a much bigger part of the global economy.” 

The market impact could be significant as well. “For long-term investors,” Sullivan says, “we believe industries levered to experiences — such as travel and live entertainment — could be particularly appealing.” 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Impactive Capital's private equity-approach to ESG-oriented activism

In contrast to the sharp-elbow tactics used by some activist investors, Lauren Taylor Wolfe and Christian Asmar set out in 2019 to launch an   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,6565847b activist investment firm that would take a long-term, collaborative approach to generate returns . The result is Impactive Capital, an ESG-oriented firm that Wolfe says takes a private equity approach with management teams and aims to double or triple the value of their businesses over a three- to five-year period. And while Wolfe notes that environmental, social, and governance investing has become a politicized term, she says ESG isn't sustainable if it doesn't link to economic returns. 

“If companies can use an environmental, a social, or a governance tool to attract and retain the stickiest customer, the stickiest employee, the stickiest shareholder, what you've done is you've lowered your customer acquisition costs, you've lowered your employee retention costs, you've lowered your cost of capital with shareholders, and you've become the most competitive, the most profitable, the most valuable company in your industry,” Wolfe says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,6565847c Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .

Is US outperformance at a turning point? 	
	
	

	

The US has had an exceptional decade. US economic growth and equities have outperformed and the dollar's global role remains unchallenged. But this outperformance has begun to show some cracks with US equities selling off over the past month. 

Rebecca Patterson, former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, believes US equities can continue outperforming over the next decade, led by tech and generative artificial intelligence. “Now that's a big statement because if we go back historically…you will see outperformance roughly for a decade, and then it tends to hand over,” Patterson says on  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658470 Goldman Sachs Exchanges , which breaks down the topic from the latest  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658471 Top of Mind report . “When I think about what could drive the next decade, I go back to tech being a possible catalyst to lead to another decade of US outperformance.”

But Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, sees this as more questionable than in the past given several “mega forces” — rather than cyclical performance — are set to drive equity performance. “If we talk about the last 20, 30 years, I think [the US] has been exceptional...but as a forward statement, I think there's more question now. I still think that business conditions that create the possibility for companies to take innovation and develop at scale is still unmatched. But there are other conditions around demographics, around geopolitics, that can now dent this benefit more than they have in the past.” 

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Chief Global Equity Strategist Peter Oppenheimer notes the US equity market is now very concentrated — with its exceptionalism owing to a handful of large companies — and is seeing increased competition from other asset classes in the current high-rate environment. “Investors need to think about diversifying geographically and across different factors and indeed sectors much more in the next decade than they were perhaps used to in the last decade,” he says. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Why electric vehicle battery prices are falling faster than expected 	
	
	

	

Not long ago, rising demand and component shortages sparked concern that “greenflation” would drive up prices for the batteries in electric vehicles.  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658473 That's subsiding as prices cool for battery metals , which could help make EVs more competitive with traditional cars more quickly.

Goldman Sachs Research now expects battery prices to fall to $99 per kilowatt hour of storage capacity by 2025 — a 40% decrease from 2022. Our analysts estimate almost half of the decline will come from declining prices of EV raw materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Battery pack prices are now expected to fall by an average of 11% per year from 2023 to 2030, writes Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research's Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, in the team's report. 

As battery prices fall, the EV market is forecast to potentially achieve cost parity, without subsidies, with internal combustion engine vehicles around the middle of this decade on a total-cost-of-ownership basis. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

The global credibility gap: assessing underperformance and overreach in geopolitics

Washington and Wall Street are worried about the same thing: geopolitics. After decades of relative international stability and increasing globalization, businesses and governments are now struggling to understand a new, more unpredictable, and more violent global reality. 

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658476 But today's geopolitical shocks are connected by a great-power credibility crisis between the US and China , which is compounding geopolitical instability and uncertainty, according to an article by Goldman Sachs' Jared Cohen, president of Global Affairs and co-head of the Office of Applied Innovation, and Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group and GZERO Media. The ongoing credibility crisis is changing geopolitics by creating geopolitical  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658477 swing states  and shifting alignments between countries. 

It is also creating space for big technology companies to play a larger role in global politics while widening a global governance deficit. 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Millennial and Gen Z values could change the economy 	
	
	

	

The  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658478 attitudes of young consumers could shift consumer spending , according to Jen Sullivan of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 

Sullivan says that when compared to their predecessors, millennial and Gen Z consumers are more likely to value experiences over physical possessions. Given these generations' rising prominence, “it's no surprise that over the past 20 years, we've seen the share of spending on services rise considerably,” she says. 	
	
	

	

 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,65658479 	
	
	

	

	

As the earning power of these generations continues to grow, Sullivan predicts “services stands to become a much bigger part of the global economy.” 

The market impact could be significant as well. “For long-term investors,” Sullivan says, “we believe industries levered to experiences — such as travel and live entertainment — could be particularly appealing.” 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Impactive Capital's private equity-approach to ESG-oriented activism

In contrast to the sharp-elbow tactics used by some activist investors, Lauren Taylor Wolfe and Christian Asmar set out in 2019 to launch an   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,6565847b activist investment firm that would take a long-term, collaborative approach to generate returns . The result is Impactive Capital, an ESG-oriented firm that Wolfe says takes a private equity approach with management teams and aims to double or triple the value of their businesses over a three- to five-year period. And while Wolfe notes that environmental, social, and governance investing has become a politicized term, she says ESG isn't sustainable if it doesn't link to economic returns. 

“If companies can use an environmental, a social, or a governance tool to attract and retain the stickiest customer, the stickiest employee, the stickiest shareholder, what you've done is you've lowered your customer acquisition costs, you've lowered your employee retention costs, you've lowered your cost of capital with shareholders, and you've become the most competitive, the most profitable, the most valuable company in your industry,” Wolfe says on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t262f0b9e,82f075b4,6565847c Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .

At the Goldman Sachs Global Sustainability Forum in New York, he said answering investors' sustainability questions requires a nimble and modern data platform as well as expertise and hard work, as not all the tools for uncovering that information are available off the shelf yet.
