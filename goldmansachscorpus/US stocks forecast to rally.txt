US stocks  are expected to rise in the coming months as the Trump administration overhauls the country's tariff policy with its largest trade partners. Goldman Sachs Research estimates the S&P 500 index will   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc3 increase about 10%  to 6,500 in the next 12 months. 

David Kostin, Goldman Sachs Research's chief US equity strategist, raised his S&P 500 forecast following developments in trade discussions between the US and China to incorporate lower tariff rates, better economic growth, and less recession risk than previously expected. Our economists estimate the US has about a 35% chance of recession in the next 12 months and that GDP will expand 1.5% in 2025. 

“Investors have generally embraced the view that there's an off-ramp for some of these hefty tariffs,” Kostin says in an episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc4 Goldman Sachs  Exchanges . “I think that largely is priced in the market.” 

The outlook for the “US exceptionalism” investment theme — the expectation for US GDP growth and market returns to outshine other regions — has been the subject of major discussion for investors as trade tensions ripple through the global economy. 

Padi Raphael, global co-head of Third Party Wealth Management in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says in the Exchanges episode that sentiment toward that theme differs somewhat around the world. US investors aren't shying away from their domestic market, she says, but at the same time there's heightened interest in some international markets and in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc5 Europe in particular .  European investors  have an increased bias toward repatriating assets to their home markets. 

Generally speaking, in Asia, “US exceptionalism and the brand recognition around US companies is still very strong” among many investors, Raphael says. “My recent conversations with investors from Asia have not reflected any kind of loss of the shine of the US as a destination for investing,” she says.

The forecast for Fed rate cuts 	
	
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research expects a slower pace of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve on signs of tariff de-escalation between the US and China. 

Our economists now expect the Fed to begin a series of three 25-basis-point cuts in December rather than in July, and to implement them at every other meeting rather than sequentially. The Federal Open Market Committee meets roughly every six to eight weeks. 

Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs Research's chief economist, writes in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc8 the team's report  that the rationale for interest rate cuts in our economists' forecast has shifted. Previously, the rationale had been insurance: pre-emptive action when the central bank sees potential weakness in the economy. 

Now the team expects that the Fed will instead start cutting with a view to slowly returning interest rates to a more conventional level “as growth remains somewhat firmer, the unemployment rate rises by somewhat less, and the urgency for policy support is reduced,” Hatzius writes. 

The team's estimate for the terminal rate — the point at which the Fed will stop cutting interest rates — is unchanged at 3.5-3.75%.

Prospects for the French economy in an age of tariffs

France's economy stands to benefit from   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769ccc increased military spending  and may be relatively less exposed to trade tensions, even as fiscal worries persist, according to Alexandre Stott, a European economist in Goldman Sachs Research. Stott and his team   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769ccd forecast  France's GDP  to expand 0.6% this year, compared with 0.1% growth in Germany and 0.9% for the euro area as a whole (as of May 16). 

A substantial portion of Europe's ramped up military spending will flow into France's large weapons industry, which manufactures air defenses and other vital systems, Stott says. France is the second-largest exporter of military goods after the US. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cce 
	

France also may be less vulnerable than its European peers to rising trade tensions. “On a relative basis, France won't be hit as hard as Germany, which is very open, or Italy, which is quite exposed through its manufacturing sector,” he explains. “As a result, France may be more shielded from the global trade tensions.” 

Still, France has run the biggest fiscal deficit in Europe. As other European nations have been reducing their deficits, France has stood out in that its deficit didn't decrease — in fact, it increased in 2024. But there are some recent signs that the government is more committed to cutting the deficit this year, although progress will be slow. “This means France now has very little space left, which is an issue when you face growth headwinds or pressure to spend on other strategic items like defense,” Stott says.

For active investors, market uncertainty can be a boon, according to TCW CEO Katie Koch. “This is a very volatile environment, and it's our market,” she says, particularly for value investors. On an episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cd2 Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors , Koch explains that TCW, a global asset manager with over $200 billion in assets under management, entered 2025 with a defensive stance, holding significant cash reserves in both private credit and public fixed income. This strategic positioning allowed TCW to capitalize on opportunities by providing liquidity when others couldn't, she says. Now, as credit becomes more appealing, Koch says, “we are seizing these dislocations to buy credit for our clients.”

US stocks are forecast to rally

US stocks  are expected to rise in the coming months as the Trump administration overhauls the country's tariff policy with its largest trade partners. Goldman Sachs Research estimates the S&P 500 index will   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc3 increase about 10%  to 6,500 in the next 12 months. 

David Kostin, Goldman Sachs Research's chief US equity strategist, raised his S&P 500 forecast following developments in trade discussions between the US and China to incorporate lower tariff rates, better economic growth, and less recession risk than previously expected. Our economists estimate the US has about a 35% chance of recession in the next 12 months and that GDP will expand 1.5% in 2025. 

“Investors have generally embraced the view that there's an off-ramp for some of these hefty tariffs,” Kostin says in an episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc4 Goldman Sachs  Exchanges . “I think that largely is priced in the market.” 

The outlook for the “US exceptionalism” investment theme — the expectation for US GDP growth and market returns to outshine other regions — has been the subject of major discussion for investors as trade tensions ripple through the global economy. 

Padi Raphael, global co-head of Third Party Wealth Management in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says in the Exchanges episode that sentiment toward that theme differs somewhat around the world. US investors aren't shying away from their domestic market, she says, but at the same time there's heightened interest in some international markets and in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc5 Europe in particular .  European investors  have an increased bias toward repatriating assets to their home markets. 

Generally speaking, in Asia, “US exceptionalism and the brand recognition around US companies is still very strong” among many investors, Raphael says. “My recent conversations with investors from Asia have not reflected any kind of loss of the shine of the US as a destination for investing,” she says.

The forecast for Fed rate cuts 	
	
	

	

Goldman Sachs Research expects a slower pace of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve on signs of tariff de-escalation between the US and China. 

Our economists now expect the Fed to begin a series of three 25-basis-point cuts in December rather than in July, and to implement them at every other meeting rather than sequentially. The Federal Open Market Committee meets roughly every six to eight weeks. 

Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs Research's chief economist, writes in   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cc8 the team's report  that the rationale for interest rate cuts in our economists' forecast has shifted. Previously, the rationale had been insurance: pre-emptive action when the central bank sees potential weakness in the economy. 

Now the team expects that the Fed will instead start cutting with a view to slowly returning interest rates to a more conventional level “as growth remains somewhat firmer, the unemployment rate rises by somewhat less, and the urgency for policy support is reduced,” Hatzius writes. 

The team's estimate for the terminal rate — the point at which the Fed will stop cutting interest rates — is unchanged at 3.5-3.75%.

Prospects for the French economy in an age of tariffs

France's economy stands to benefit from   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769ccc increased military spending  and may be relatively less exposed to trade tensions, even as fiscal worries persist, according to Alexandre Stott, a European economist in Goldman Sachs Research. Stott and his team   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769ccd forecast  France's GDP  to expand 0.6% this year, compared with 0.1% growth in Germany and 0.9% for the euro area as a whole (as of May 16). 

A substantial portion of Europe's ramped up military spending will flow into France's large weapons industry, which manufactures air defenses and other vital systems, Stott says. France is the second-largest exporter of military goods after the US.

France also may be less vulnerable than its European peers to rising trade tensions. “On a relative basis, France won't be hit as hard as Germany, which is very open, or Italy, which is quite exposed through its manufacturing sector,” he explains. “As a result, France may be more shielded from the global trade tensions.” 

Still, France has run the biggest fiscal deficit in Europe. As other European nations have been reducing their deficits, France has stood out in that its deficit didn't decrease — in fact, it increased in 2024. But there are some recent signs that the government is more committed to cutting the deficit this year, although progress will be slow. “This means France now has very little space left, which is an issue when you face growth headwinds or pressure to spend on other strategic items like defense,” Stott says.

For active investors, market uncertainty can be a boon, according to TCW CEO Katie Koch. “This is a very volatile environment, and it's our market,” she says, particularly for value investors. On an episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36e9928a,99da8757,65769cd2 Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors , Koch explains that TCW, a global asset manager with over $200 billion in assets under management, entered 2025 with a defensive stance, holding significant cash reserves in both private credit and public fixed income. This strategic positioning allowed TCW to capitalize on opportunities by providing liquidity when others couldn't, she says. Now, as credit becomes more appealing, Koch says, “we are seizing these dislocations to buy credit for our clients.”
