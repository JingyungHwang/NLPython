Engineers are racing to create a safe superintelligence —   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d2 an artificial intelligence that can think and reason , with an intellect far superior to our own. Such a superintelligence would be an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that exceeds human capabilities across all — or most — human cognitive tasks, says Dimitris Tsementzis, who leads the Applied Artificial Intelligence team in Goldman Sachs' Engineering Division .   

The types of tasks that a superintelligence deserving of the name would be able to carry out include: solving mathematical conjectures that have eluded humans (e.g. the Millennium problems); predicting the weather accurately five years in advance versus, say, five days; or constructing molecules to cure any viral or genetic disease.   

But there are at least three fundamental research challenges to building a safe superintelligence, Tsementzis writes. These are: getting models to re-train themselves speedily in new tasks or in the face of new information; building them to think structurally, so that they can, for instance, produce metaphors or unexpected analogies; and imparting a human sense of ethics to these superintelligences.    

It isn't yet clear if such superintelligences will be commercially viable or useful. “More realistically, with the current architectures, the technology sector is on the path to super-automation, and new insights will be needed to take us to the path to superintelligence,” T sementzis writes.

EV battery prices are expected to fall 50% by 2026 	
	
	

	

Technology advances that have allowed electric vehicle battery makers to increase energy density, combined with a drop in green metal prices,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d4 will push battery prices lower than previously expected , according to Goldman Sachs Research.  

Global average battery prices declined from $153 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2022 to $149 in 2023, and they're projected to fall to $111 by the close of this year. Our researchers forecast that average battery prices could fall towards $80/kWh by 2026, amounting to a drop of almost 50% from 2023, a level at which battery EVs would achieve ownership cost parity with gasoline-fueled cars in the US on an unsubsidized basis.

"We are seeing multiple new battery products that have been launched that feature about 30% higher energy density and lower cost,” says Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research's Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research. “The second driver is a continued downturn in battery metal prices. That includes lithium and cobalt, and nearly 60% of the cost of batteries is from metals.” 
Admittedly, near-term EV battery demand remains more dependent on regulations. But soon, falling battery prices are likely to bring consumers in off the sidelines. “We think we're going to see a strong comeback in demand in 2026 purely from an economics perspective,” Bhandari says. “We believe 2026 is when a consumer-led adoption phase will largely begin.”

Global trade is showing resilience despite rising barriers 	
	
	

	

Efforts to upend the globalization of trade and manufacturing have yet to put the trend into reverse. In fact,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d7 Asia's share of world manufacturing and exports  has continued to increase,  says Patrick Creuset , senior analyst for the European transport, infrastructure, and construction sectors in Goldman Sachs Research. His group maps the fastest-growing trade routes, and all of the top 10 originate in Asia. A majority originate in China. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d8 
	

To be sure, there has been a slowdown in the growth of global trade. “The wave of China-driven trade globalization that we saw in the decades leading up to the Great Financial Crisis peaked in 2008,” Creuset says. “But it has not really gone into reverse.”   

Creuset's work analyzing trade data shows that overall volume continues to grow modestly and that the shipment of goods around the planet is increasingly complex. Multi-sourcing supply chain strategies, trade barriers, and geopolitical frictions can all make trade more intricate and difficult. Those factors are creating opportunities for logistics and shipping companies, Creuset says.

Karen Karniol-Tambour, the co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, believes the US economy will be able to sustain its current level of growth. “It's a very unique spot to be in, so late into an expansion,” Karniol-Tambour tells Goldman Sachs' Tony Pasquariello on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010da Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .  

“All it will take is one AI-powered startup in your industry to say: 'Wait a minute, I better go invest a lot in AI as well,'” says Karniol-Tambour . “You can look back to the 1990s and that midcycle easing, and how big the capex cycle in the internet boom was in powering the next leg. I think this is about as good of a backdrop as you could get so long into an expansion to be able to sustain growth. And you have a Fed that, with inflation where it is, is both willing and able to do more if it needs to.”    

Meanwhile, as inflation and interest rates across global economies start to diverge, Karniol-Tambour sees opportunities in global currencies. “The world's not as synchronized,” she says. “Inflation is different in different countries. You're getting policy normalization differently in different countries. And that's what really drives currency moves,” she says. “I do think there are bigger alpha opportunities than there have been in a long time and it's also a really important time to kind of structurally consider: 'What am I doing with currencies in my portfolio?'”

Better-than-expected earnings growth, on the back of an economy that is continuing to expand, is likely to drive US stocks higher over the next year. “The idea that the economy is growing suggests that if fair value is around the current level, then the forward trajectory of the index is going to be driven by earnings as opposed to a valuation expansion,” says David Kostin, Goldman Sachs Research's chief US equity strategist, on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010dc Goldman Sachs Exchanges . 

Kostin, whose team recently boosted its year-end and 12-month targets for the S&P 500, now expects the index to hit around 6,300 a year from now. And while this year's gains in megacap tech stocks have pushed up overall valuations, investors can still find attractively priced opportunities in mid-cap equities , adds Ryan Hammond, US equity strategist.  

At the same time, market breadth — a measure of how concentrated returns are in a given group of stocks — is roughly in line with historical averages, Hammond says. “The typical stock has started to participate in this year's rally,” he says.

Engineers are racing to create a safe superintelligence —   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d2 an artificial intelligence that can think and reason , with an intellect far superior to our own.

Will AI lead to superintelligence or just super-automation?

Engineers are racing to create a safe superintelligence —   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d2 an artificial intelligence that can think and reason , with an intellect far superior to our own. Such a superintelligence would be an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that exceeds human capabilities across all — or most — human cognitive tasks, says Dimitris Tsementzis, who leads the Applied Artificial Intelligence team in Goldman Sachs' Engineering Division .   

The types of tasks that a superintelligence deserving of the name would be able to carry out include: solving mathematical conjectures that have eluded humans (e.g. the Millennium problems); predicting the weather accurately five years in advance versus, say, five days; or constructing molecules to cure any viral or genetic disease.   

But there are at least three fundamental research challenges to building a safe superintelligence, Tsementzis writes. These are: getting models to re-train themselves speedily in new tasks or in the face of new information; building them to think structurally, so that they can, for instance, produce metaphors or unexpected analogies; and imparting a human sense of ethics to these superintelligences.    

It isn't yet clear if such superintelligences will be commercially viable or useful. “More realistically, with the current architectures, the technology sector is on the path to super-automation, and new insights will be needed to take us to the path to superintelligence,” T sementzis writes.

EV battery prices are expected to fall 50% by 2026 	
	
	

	

Technology advances that have allowed electric vehicle battery makers to increase energy density, combined with a drop in green metal prices,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d4 will push battery prices lower than previously expected , according to Goldman Sachs Research.  

Global average battery prices declined from $153 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2022 to $149 in 2023, and they're projected to fall to $111 by the close of this year. Our researchers forecast that average battery prices could fall towards $80/kWh by 2026, amounting to a drop of almost 50% from 2023, a level at which battery EVs would achieve ownership cost parity with gasoline-fueled cars in the US on an unsubsidized basis.

"We are seeing multiple new battery products that have been launched that feature about 30% higher energy density and lower cost,” says Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research's Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research. “The second driver is a continued downturn in battery metal prices. That includes lithium and cobalt, and nearly 60% of the cost of batteries is from metals.” 
Admittedly, near-term EV battery demand remains more dependent on regulations. But soon, falling battery prices are likely to bring consumers in off the sidelines. “We think we're going to see a strong comeback in demand in 2026 purely from an economics perspective,” Bhandari says. “We believe 2026 is when a consumer-led adoption phase will largely begin.”

Global trade is showing resilience despite rising barriers 	
	
	

	

Efforts to upend the globalization of trade and manufacturing have yet to put the trend into reverse. In fact,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d7 Asia's share of world manufacturing and exports  has continued to increase,  says Patrick Creuset , senior analyst for the European transport, infrastructure, and construction sectors in Goldman Sachs Research. His group maps the fastest-growing trade routes, and all of the top 10 originate in Asia. A majority originate in China. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010d8 
	

To be sure, there has been a slowdown in the growth of global trade. “The wave of China-driven trade globalization that we saw in the decades leading up to the Great Financial Crisis peaked in 2008,” Creuset says. “But it has not really gone into reverse.”   

Creuset's work analyzing trade data shows that overall volume continues to grow modestly and that the shipment of goods around the planet is increasingly complex. Multi-sourcing supply chain strategies, trade barriers, and geopolitical frictions can all make trade more intricate and difficult. Those factors are creating opportunities for logistics and shipping companies, Creuset says. 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Where the world's largest hedge fund sees investing opportunities

Karen Karniol-Tambour, the co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, believes the US economy will be able to sustain its current level of growth. “It's a very unique spot to be in, so late into an expansion,” Karniol-Tambour tells Goldman Sachs' Tony Pasquariello on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010da Goldman Sachs Exchanges: Great Investors .  

“All it will take is one AI-powered startup in your industry to say: 'Wait a minute, I better go invest a lot in AI as well,'” says Karniol-Tambour . “You can look back to the 1990s and that midcycle easing, and how big the capex cycle in the internet boom was in powering the next leg. I think this is about as good of a backdrop as you could get so long into an expansion to be able to sustain growth. And you have a Fed that, with inflation where it is, is both willing and able to do more if it needs to.”    

Meanwhile, as inflation and interest rates across global economies start to diverge, Karniol-Tambour sees opportunities in global currencies. “The world's not as synchronized,” she says. “Inflation is different in different countries. You're getting policy normalization differently in different countries. And that's what really drives currency moves,” she says. “I do think there are bigger alpha opportunities than there have been in a long time and it's also a really important time to kind of structurally consider: 'What am I doing with currencies in my portfolio?'” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Can US stocks keep rallying?

Better-than-expected earnings growth, on the back of an economy that is continuing to expand, is likely to drive US stocks higher over the next year. “The idea that the economy is growing suggests that if fair value is around the current level, then the forward trajectory of the index is going to be driven by earnings as opposed to a valuation expansion,” says David Kostin, Goldman Sachs Research's chief US equity strategist, on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t308ba801,90fa44d9,657010dc Goldman Sachs Exchanges . 

Kostin, whose team recently boosted its year-end and 12-month targets for the S&P 500, now expects the index to hit around 6,300 a year from now. And while this year's gains in megacap tech stocks have pushed up overall valuations, investors can still find attractively priced opportunities in mid-cap equities , adds Ryan Hammond, US equity strategist.  

At the same time, market breadth — a measure of how concentrated returns are in a given group of stocks — is roughly in line with historical averages, Hammond says. “The typical stock has started to participate in this year's rally,” he says.
