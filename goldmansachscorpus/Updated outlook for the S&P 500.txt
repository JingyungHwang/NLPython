The S&P 500 may rise less than expected as GDP growth slows 	
	
	

	

Amid signs of slowing US GDP growth and a spike in trade-policy uncertainty, Goldman Sachs Research revised its year-end   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff00 forecast for the S&P 500 Index  from 6500 to 6200. This suggests an increase of about 7% in the price of the index throughout the rest of the year (as of March 25). Equities have also been buffeted by investors — particularly hedge funds — unwinding portfolio positions. 

“The headwinds to equity valuations from a spike in uncertainty are typically relatively short lived,” says Goldman Sachs Research Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin. “However, an outlook for slower growth suggests lower valuations on a more sustained basis.”   

Over the last 40 years, the S&P 500 index has experienced a drawdown, or peak-to-trough decline, of 10% in the average year — that's in line with this year's earlier 10% decline. 
	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff01 
	

	

“Outside of a recession, history shows that S&P 500 drawdowns are usually good buying opportunities if the economy and earnings continue to grow,” Kostin writes. Our economists forecast US GDP growth of 1.7% in 2025.  

During the last 40 years, an investor buying the S&P 500 after it declined 10% from its high would have enjoyed a positive return in the subsequent six months some 76% of the time.   

To protect their portfolios against volatility, Kostin's team suggests that investors screen for the stocks with low sensitivity to major themes driving market fluctuations such as US economic growth, trade risk, and AI.

The future of work: AI and the hybrid workforce

Companies are still in the early stages of adopting artificial intelligence, facing challenges like cultural inertia and the need for specialized training. 

“The biggest friction point to adoption of AI in the enterprise is people, is behaviors, is the fact that you have muscle groups that you need to retrain,” Marco Argenti, Goldman Sachs' chief information officer, tells Allison Nathan, senior strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, and George Lee, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff04 Goldman Sachs Exchanges . 

Argenti also highlights the importance of creating a hybrid workforce where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly, much like the cloud has revolutionized server management. If anything, he adds, AI makes the role of humans even more important, because everyone becomes a manager of agents, and becomes responsible for the work that those agents do. “The centrality of professionalism and high judgment has never been more important than now.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	
	
	

	

Are US stocks vulnerable to further declines? 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff05 
	

The recent drop in US stocks, marked by a 10% correction in the S&P 500, was fueled by high investor expectations at the start of the year, emerging signs of slowing economic growth, and the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff announcements. 

Despite the significant selloff, Goldman Sachs Research's equity drawdown risk model still signals a   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff06 high probability of further declines . Christian Mueller-Glissmann, head of asset allocation research, warns that both macroeconomic and market conditions have deteriorated, suggesting that the correction may not be over yet. 

“You cannot sound the all-clear at this point,” he says. “There's still a risk of the equity correction continuing.” But he adds that signs of an improving economic situation or a policy pivot from President Trump or the Federal Reserve could help markets recover faster. 

The higher than usual risk of stock market declines underscores the importance of diversification, Mueller-Glissmann says. This includes diversifying both across and within asset classes, such as balancing equity exposure with bonds and considering equities from non-US markets. The team also recommends diversifying across investment styles, particularly by considering low-volatility stocks from defensive sectors, which have shown resilience in recent weeks.  
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

How fundraising for European technology is changing 	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff07 
	

Europe is well-positioned to become a launchpad for large technology players, but its system for funding private companies still has room to improve,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff08 according to Taavet Hinrikus , founding partner at the venture capital firm Plural and co-founder of the financial services company Wise. 

One example is the distribution of investors for private companies in Europe. When Hinrikus started Wise, he was drawn to investors who had experience in founding and building companies, he said at Goldman Sachs' Disruptive Technology Symposium in London. Yet many European venture capitalists don't come from that background. In fact, 90% of general partners in the region are ex-bankers or consultants. 

“There's nothing wrong with that — for later-stage investing, it's great,” Hinrikus told attendees of the event. “But for the early, transformative stages, we strongly feel that the scar tissue makes you a better partner to entrepreneurs,” he added. 

Looking to the future of European technology, Hinrikus said investors need to be more willing to take risks on deep technology companies — companies founded with the goal of solving specific engineering challenges. Many of the world's biggest technology firms, from microchip giants to spacecraft manufacturers, fall into this category. 

“I think that's something which is oftentimes missing in Europe. It's easy to finance a Software-as-a-Service company, and most European venture firms are happy to do that,” Hinrikus said. “But… I think we'll see a lot more outcomes in the field of deep tech in the future.” 

He pointed to his native Estonia, which ranks among the world's top countries for per-capita company creation rates in the technology sector, as a model for Europe. In addition to its high level of tech literacy and entrepreneurial culture, Hinrikus said, Estonia benefitted from some early internet companies that accelerated the development of its tech ecosystem.

Equities have also been buffeted by investors — particularly hedge funds — unwinding portfolio positions. 

“The headwinds to equity valuations from a spike in uncertainty are typically relatively short lived,” says Goldman Sachs Research Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin. “However, an outlook for slower growth suggests lower valuations on a more sustained basis.”   

Over the last 40 years, the S&P 500 index has experienced a drawdown, or peak-to-trough decline, of 10% in the average year — that's in line with this year's earlier 10% decline.

“Outside of a recession, history shows that S&P 500 drawdowns are usually good buying opportunities if the economy and earnings continue to grow,” Kostin writes. Our economists forecast US GDP growth of 1.7% in 2025.  

During the last 40 years, an investor buying the S&P 500 after it declined 10% from its high would have enjoyed a positive return in the subsequent six months some 76% of the time.   

To protect their portfolios against volatility, Kostin's team suggests that investors screen for the stocks with low sensitivity to major themes driving market fluctuations such as US economic growth, trade risk, and AI.

Companies are still in the early stages of adopting artificial intelligence, facing challenges like cultural inertia and the need for specialized training. 

“The biggest friction point to adoption of AI in the enterprise is people, is behaviors, is the fact that you have muscle groups that you need to retrain,” Marco Argenti, Goldman Sachs' chief information officer, tells Allison Nathan, senior strategist at Goldman Sachs Research, and George Lee, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, on   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff04 Goldman Sachs Exchanges . 

Argenti also highlights the importance of creating a hybrid workforce where humans and AI can collaborate seamlessly, much like the cloud has revolutionized server management. If anything, he adds, AI makes the role of humans even more important, because everyone becomes a manager of agents, and becomes responsible for the work that those agents do. “The centrality of professionalism and high judgment has never been more important than now.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	
	
	

	

Are US stocks vulnerable to further declines? 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff05 
	

The recent drop in US stocks, marked by a 10% correction in the S&P 500, was fueled by high investor expectations at the start of the year, emerging signs of slowing economic growth, and the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff announcements. 

Despite the significant selloff, Goldman Sachs Research's equity drawdown risk model still signals a   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff06 high probability of further declines . Christian Mueller-Glissmann, head of asset allocation research, warns that both macroeconomic and market conditions have deteriorated, suggesting that the correction may not be over yet. 

“You cannot sound the all-clear at this point,” he says. “There's still a risk of the equity correction continuing.” But he adds that signs of an improving economic situation or a policy pivot from President Trump or the Federal Reserve could help markets recover faster. 

The higher than usual risk of stock market declines underscores the importance of diversification, Mueller-Glissmann says. This includes diversifying both across and within asset classes, such as balancing equity exposure with bonds and considering equities from non-US markets. The team also recommends diversifying across investment styles, particularly by considering low-volatility stocks from defensive sectors, which have shown resilience in recent weeks.  
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

How fundraising for European technology is changing 	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff07 
	

Europe is well-positioned to become a launchpad for large technology players, but its system for funding private companies still has room to improve,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t35543122,97c03204,6574ff08 according to Taavet Hinrikus , founding partner at the venture capital firm Plural and co-founder of the financial services company Wise. 

One example is the distribution of investors for private companies in Europe. When Hinrikus started Wise, he was drawn to investors who had experience in founding and building companies, he said at Goldman Sachs' Disruptive Technology Symposium in London. Yet many European venture capitalists don't come from that background. In fact, 90% of general partners in the region are ex-bankers or consultants. 

“There's nothing wrong with that — for later-stage investing, it's great,” Hinrikus told attendees of the event. “But for the early, transformative stages, we strongly feel that the scar tissue makes you a better partner to entrepreneurs,” he added. 

Looking to the future of European technology, Hinrikus said investors need to be more willing to take risks on deep technology companies — companies founded with the goal of solving specific engineering challenges. Many of the world's biggest technology firms, from microchip giants to spacecraft manufacturers, fall into this category. 

“I think that's something which is oftentimes missing in Europe. It's easy to finance a Software-as-a-Service company, and most European venture firms are happy to do that,” Hinrikus said. “But… I think we'll see a lot more outcomes in the field of deep tech in the future.” 

He pointed to his native Estonia, which ranks among the world's top countries for per-capita company creation rates in the technology sector, as a model for Europe. In addition to its high level of tech literacy and entrepreneurial culture, Hinrikus said, Estonia benefitted from some early internet companies that accelerated the development of its tech ecosystem.
