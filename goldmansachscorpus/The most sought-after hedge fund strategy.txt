Hedge funds investing in credit are in demand 	
	
	

	

	

Asset allocators are, for a second year in a row,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912d9 more interested in hedge funds that invest in credit  than in any other strategy. 

The demand for credit hedge fund strategies (which include the trading of assets like company debt, structured credit, and some sovereign instruments) comes after both bonds and stocks rallied last year, according to the Goldman Sachs Prime Services Hedge Funds Insights and Analytics team's 2024 Hedge Fund Industry Outlook. 

Capital allocators reported an average gain of 6.4% from their hedge fund portfolios between January and November 2023, up from a 0.9% loss in the same period in 2022. The report includes a survey of responses from 358 allocator firms globally, who control more than $1 trillion of assets allocated to hedge funds, as well as responses from 302 hedge fund managers who are clients of Goldman Sachs' Prime Services business and collectively manage more than $1 trillion.

	- Some 44% of investors plan to increase their exposure to hedge funds with a credit strategy this year and only 3% plan to decrease it. As in the previous report, distressed company credit and long-short credit (a strategy of betting on appreciation as well as depreciation, often including hedging) were the most sought-after sub-strategies for hedge funds. 
	- Demand for Asia-focused hedge funds peaked in 2021, with almost half of allocators surveyed expressing interest in increasing their exposure to the region. Now it's the least sought-after, falling behind Europe and North America. Interest has increased slightly for Japan and pan-Asia strategies at the expense of demand for China, which continues to decline. 
	- Despite positive returns (on average) in 2023, hedge funds underperformed traditional 60/40 portfolios (which allocate 60% of funds to S&P 500 stocks and 40% to 10-year US Treasury bonds) by the widest margin in since 2000. Hedge funds came into the year defensively positioned and struggled to keep pace.

Supply chains are shifting between China, Korea, Taiwan, and the US 	
	
	

	
  
	

Asia's supply chains are shifting. In December 2023, combined exports from Korea and Taiwan to the US exceeded their exports to mainland China for the first time in two decades, according to Goldman Sachs Research. 
  
The changes are taking place amid several important shifts. China's unit labor costs have risen (from 30% of US levels in 2000, based on purchasing power, to nearly 70% in 2019), and its industrial structure is becoming more sophisticated. As China moves up the value chain and drives for greater self-sufficiency, it has reduced imports of intermediate goods (notably chemicals, automobile parts, and electronic components) while increasing its imports of final consumer goods. 

China's supply chains for the electronics industry are potentially vulnerable to these changes. Some tech imports into China are still used mostly for re-export — for instance, 57% of China's microchip imports in 2023 were re-exported. The large portion of imports for re-export in the electronics industry means that relocation of factories assembling technologies such as smartphones from China to elsewhere in the region could redirect both imports and exports of tech products away from China. 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

	

Companies' post-pandemic focus on supply chain diversification and the US's supply chain resilience programs are also reshaping trade in the region. Supply chains around advanced microchips have been shifting away from China since the pandemic outbreak in early 2020. Notably, changes in trade flows for smartphones have accelerated since the pandemic with rapid declines in imports of made-in-China smartphones in the US and Europe. (Admittedly, smartphones made in other countries might still use key components from Chinese factories.) 

Moreover,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912dc accelerating innovation in AI  and the US drive for supply chain resilience have boosted US demand for AI chips. All these developments have led to sharp increases in US-bound exports from Korea and Taiwan of AI servers and their advanced chip components. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

A midsummer expectation for the Fed's first rate cut 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912dd 
	

	

The Federal Reserve will likely begin cutting interest rates when inflation is still modestly above the 2% target,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912de according to the Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) . The Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated as much in a press conference following the central bank's policy meeting in December. “You wouldn't wait to get to 2% to cut rates, [as that] would be too late,” Powell said. “You'd want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2%.” The Fed's estimate of the nominal neutral rate is 2.5%, and with the target range currently at 5.25-5.5%, the policymakers believe there's plenty of room for cuts while maintaining an overall restrictive stance. 

That said, the Fed also declared, at its January meeting, that it “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.” More recently, Fed commentary suggests that a rate cut in May would probably be too soon. For this reason, combined with hotter-than-expected January inflation data, ISG has pushed back its expectation for the timing of the first rate cut from March to June, even as ISG continues to expect four 25-basis-point cuts this year. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

High mortgage rates, limited inventory continue to challenge the US housing market 	
	
	

	

	

High mortgage rates and limited inventory have created one of the tightest US housing markets in decades. While mortgage rates are likely to ease somewhat if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later this year, as is widely expected, the supply of available homes still needs to catch up to demand, according to Goldman Sachs Research's Roger Ashworth. 

Average mortgage rates, currently at 7%, would need to fall closer to the average outstanding loan rate of about 3.8% to incentivize current homeowners to move,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912df says Ashworth on Goldman Sachs Exchanges . “If I go buy a house down the street, it's going to cost significantly more at a much higher mortgage rate. Around 97% of the mortgage market right now is out of the money to refinance their loan and likely not thinking about moving anytime soon.”

Roger Ashworth (L) and Allison Nathan of Goldman Sachs Research 	
	
	

	

Homebuilders are working through supply chain delays and labor shortages, which have constrained the inventory of new homes in the market since the pandemic, Ashworth says. That limited supply is another reason that home prices   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912e1 are expected to appreciate by about 5%  this year. The lack of buyers for mortgage bonds is another critical factor keeping mortgage rates high, he says. Once interest rates start to fall, more banks are likely to step back in as buyers; Ashworth expects mortgage rates to fall to about 6.3% by the end of this year and to 6% by the end of 2025.

Capital allocators reported an average gain of 6.4% from their hedge fund portfolios between January and November 2023, up from a 0.9% loss in the same period in 2022. The report includes a survey of responses from 358 allocator firms globally, who control more than $1 trillion of assets allocated to hedge funds, as well as responses from 302 hedge fund managers who are clients of Goldman Sachs' Prime Services business and collectively manage more than $1 trillion.

	- Some 44% of investors plan to increase their exposure to hedge funds with a credit strategy this year and only 3% plan to decrease it. As in the previous report, distressed company credit and long-short credit (a strategy of betting on appreciation as well as depreciation, often including hedging) were the most sought-after sub-strategies for hedge funds. 
	- Demand for Asia-focused hedge funds peaked in 2021, with almost half of allocators surveyed expressing interest in increasing their exposure to the region. Now it's the least sought-after, falling behind Europe and North America. Interest has increased slightly for Japan and pan-Asia strategies at the expense of demand for China, which continues to decline. 
	- Despite positive returns (on average) in 2023, hedge funds underperformed traditional 60/40 portfolios (which allocate 60% of funds to S&P 500 stocks and 40% to 10-year US Treasury bonds) by the widest margin in since 2000. Hedge funds came into the year defensively positioned and struggled to keep pace.

Supply chains are shifting between China, Korea, Taiwan, and the US 	
	
	

	
  
	

Asia's supply chains are shifting. In December 2023, combined exports from Korea and Taiwan to the US exceeded their exports to mainland China for the first time in two decades, according to Goldman Sachs Research. 
  
The changes are taking place amid several important shifts. China's unit labor costs have risen (from 30% of US levels in 2000, based on purchasing power, to nearly 70% in 2019), and its industrial structure is becoming more sophisticated. As China moves up the value chain and drives for greater self-sufficiency, it has reduced imports of intermediate goods (notably chemicals, automobile parts, and electronic components) while increasing its imports of final consumer goods. 

China's supply chains for the electronics industry are potentially vulnerable to these changes. Some tech imports into China are still used mostly for re-export — for instance, 57% of China's microchip imports in 2023 were re-exported. The large portion of imports for re-export in the electronics industry means that relocation of factories assembling technologies such as smartphones from China to elsewhere in the region could redirect both imports and exports of tech products away from China. 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

	

Companies' post-pandemic focus on supply chain diversification and the US's supply chain resilience programs are also reshaping trade in the region. Supply chains around advanced microchips have been shifting away from China since the pandemic outbreak in early 2020. Notably, changes in trade flows for smartphones have accelerated since the pandemic with rapid declines in imports of made-in-China smartphones in the US and Europe. (Admittedly, smartphones made in other countries might still use key components from Chinese factories.) 

Moreover,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912dc accelerating innovation in AI  and the US drive for supply chain resilience have boosted US demand for AI chips. All these developments have led to sharp increases in US-bound exports from Korea and Taiwan of AI servers and their advanced chip components. 	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

A midsummer expectation for the Fed's first rate cut

The Federal Reserve will likely begin cutting interest rates when inflation is still modestly above the 2% target,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912de according to the Wealth Management Investment Strategy Group (ISG) . The Fed chair Jerome Powell indicated as much in a press conference following the central bank's policy meeting in December. “You wouldn't wait to get to 2% to cut rates, [as that] would be too late,” Powell said. “You'd want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2%.” The Fed's estimate of the nominal neutral rate is 2.5%, and with the target range currently at 5.25-5.5%, the policymakers believe there's plenty of room for cuts while maintaining an overall restrictive stance. 

That said, the Fed also declared, at its January meeting, that it “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.” More recently, Fed commentary suggests that a rate cut in May would probably be too soon. For this reason, combined with hotter-than-expected January inflation data, ISG has pushed back its expectation for the timing of the first rate cut from March to June, even as ISG continues to expect four 25-basis-point cuts this year. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

High mortgage rates, limited inventory continue to challenge the US housing market 	
	
	

	

	

High mortgage rates and limited inventory have created one of the tightest US housing markets in decades. While mortgage rates are likely to ease somewhat if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later this year, as is widely expected, the supply of available homes still needs to catch up to demand, according to Goldman Sachs Research's Roger Ashworth. 

Average mortgage rates, currently at 7%, would need to fall closer to the average outstanding loan rate of about 3.8% to incentivize current homeowners to move,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912df says Ashworth on Goldman Sachs Exchanges . “If I go buy a house down the street, it's going to cost significantly more at a much higher mortgage rate. Around 97% of the mortgage market right now is out of the money to refinance their loan and likely not thinking about moving anytime soon.”

Homebuilders are working through supply chain delays and labor shortages, which have constrained the inventory of new homes in the market since the pandemic, Ashworth says. That limited supply is another reason that home prices   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t2a46084d,87e6de86,656912e1 are expected to appreciate by about 5%  this year. The lack of buyers for mortgage bonds is another critical factor keeping mortgage rates high, he says. Once interest rates start to fall, more banks are likely to step back in as buyers; Ashworth expects mortgage rates to fall to about 6.3% by the end of this year and to 6% by the end of 2025.
