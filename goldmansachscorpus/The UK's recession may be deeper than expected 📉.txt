The UK is expected to have a ‘significant' recession 	
	
	

	

After weeks of financial turmoil in the U.K ., the country is  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1d86e2c4,6c455af1,655b079d now expected to slide into a deeper recession , according to Goldman Sachs Research.

	- Recent fiscal U-turns on a government mini-budget and the appointment of a new prime minister, Rishi Sunak , have eased market tensions after a period of elevated volatility, but the country still faces (in Rishi Sunak's own words) a “profound economic challenge.” 
	- A four-quarter cumulative decline in GDP of 1.6% is now expected, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our Chief European Economist Sven Jari Stehn  says a “significant” recession is now the likely case for the U.K.  
	- “The combination of rapid and unfunded fiscal expansion made financial markets very nervous. Markets were unsure of how fiscal sustainability would be restored,” Stehn says. “We have now seen a U-turn on many of those government tax cuts, and markets have started to stabilize off the back of that.” 
	- The sharp selloff in gilts that followed the mini-budget had spillover effects for bond yields in other countries, but these effects weren't “systemic,” according to Stehn.

Rental prices are likely to keep US inflation high next year  	
	
	

	

Higher rents  were a big driver in September's higher-than-expected consumer price index reading and could be the source of inflation “stickiness,”   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1d86e2c4,6c455af1,655b07a1 according to Goldman Sachs Research. 

Rent measures from companies like CoreLogic, CoStar, Zillow and Yardi have slowed substantially to an annualized growth rate of 3% in recent months. But those measures include only new leases, while CPI includes both new and continuing leases for existing tenants. 

Existing tenants tend to see smaller rent hikes than prospective tenants seeking new leases because landlords are reluctant to alienate and lose them. “The difference is especially important at the moment because market rents on new leases grew very quickly over the last two years and opened a substantial gap with rents on continuing leases,” our economists wrote. Rent growth for existing tenants is likely to run hotter as it plays catch up with high (albeit softening) market rates. 

GS Research estimates that this catch-up effect boosted continuing-lease rent growth to an annualized rate above 8% in recent months, pushing monthly shelter inflation in the September CPI report to the highest on record — even as the alternative rent measures decelerated. 

Our economists forecast only 3% rent growth on new leases next year, but project that ongoing catch-up of continuing lease rents will cause CPI shelter inflation to rise from 6.8% year-on-year at present to a peak of 7.5% next spring and to remain at a still-high 5.9% year-on-year growth rate by the end of 2023.

	- A  challenging macroeconomic environment  can be both a  headwind and a tailwind . For Brex, an integrated corporate card and spend management solution, the drop in consumer spending and advertising has been a headwind, but new business is growing exponentially, Dubugras tells Goldman Sachs' Kim Posnett . “Every business is thinking about costs,” he says.  
	- It's important to build a culture of trust . “As you go into some of these harder macroeconomic times – you want to make sure that you have a team that's in that bunker with you that you can really trust to go and spearhead some really big, risky initiatives,” says Childers of Chief, a private women's network whose mission is to drive more women into positions of power.

If y ou're not a fan of the word  “deglobalization ,” which has been a popular phrase to describe diminishing global integration, Scott Kapnick , the founder & CEO of HPS Investment Partners, agrees. In the latest episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1d86e2c4,6c455af1,655b07aa Talks at GS , Kapnick says the term global “realignment” is more appropriate. But he doesn't downplay its impact on global supply chains, growth and the level of uncertainty in the world right now. 

“The big issue with deglobalization is the focus now on resiliency of supply chain. So, we're a lender. We want to focus on how people are doing that,” Kapnick tells host  Alison Mass .

After weeks of financial turmoil in the U.K ., the country is  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1d86e2c4,6c455af1,655b079d now expected to slide into a deeper recession , according to Goldman Sachs Research.

	- Recent fiscal U-turns on a government mini-budget and the appointment of a new prime minister, Rishi Sunak , have eased market tensions after a period of elevated volatility, but the country still faces (in Rishi Sunak's own words) a “profound economic challenge.” 
	- A four-quarter cumulative decline in GDP of 1.6% is now expected, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our Chief European Economist Sven Jari Stehn  says a “significant” recession is now the likely case for the U.K.  
	- “The combination of rapid and unfunded fiscal expansion made financial markets very nervous. Markets were unsure of how fiscal sustainability would be restored,” Stehn says. “We have now seen a U-turn on many of those government tax cuts, and markets have started to stabilize off the back of that.” 
	- The sharp selloff in gilts that followed the mini-budget had spillover effects for bond yields in other countries, but these effects weren't “systemic,” according to Stehn.

Rental prices are likely to keep US inflation high next year  	
	
	

	

Higher rents  were a big driver in September's higher-than-expected consumer price index reading and could be the source of inflation “stickiness,”   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1d86e2c4,6c455af1,655b07a1 according to Goldman Sachs Research. 

Rent measures from companies like CoreLogic, CoStar, Zillow and Yardi have slowed substantially to an annualized growth rate of 3% in recent months. But those measures include only new leases, while CPI includes both new and continuing leases for existing tenants. 

Existing tenants tend to see smaller rent hikes than prospective tenants seeking new leases because landlords are reluctant to alienate and lose them. “The difference is especially important at the moment because market rents on new leases grew very quickly over the last two years and opened a substantial gap with rents on continuing leases,” our economists wrote. Rent growth for existing tenants is likely to run hotter as it plays catch up with high (albeit softening) market rates. 

GS Research estimates that this catch-up effect boosted continuing-lease rent growth to an annualized rate above 8% in recent months, pushing monthly shelter inflation in the September CPI report to the highest on record — even as the alternative rent measures decelerated. 

Our economists forecast only 3% rent growth on new leases next year, but project that ongoing catch-up of continuing lease rents will cause CPI shelter inflation to rise from 6.8% year-on-year at present to a peak of 7.5% next spring and to remain at a still-high 5.9% year-on-year growth rate by the end of 2023.

In the latest episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1d86e2c4,6c455af1,655b07a3 Exchanges at Goldman Sachs , two of the entrepreneurs — Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras  and Chief co-founder and CEO Carolyn Childers  — from Goldman Sachs' 2022 Builders and Innovators Summit  share their founder journeys, as well as the challenges and opportunities they're facing as they build their businesses.

	- A  challenging macroeconomic environment  can be both a  headwind and a tailwind . For Brex, an integrated corporate card and spend management solution, the drop in consumer spending and advertising has been a headwind, but new business is growing exponentially, Dubugras tells Goldman Sachs' Kim Posnett . “Every business is thinking about costs,” he says.  
	- It's important to build a culture of trust . “As you go into some of these harder macroeconomic times – you want to make sure that you have a team that's in that bunker with you that you can really trust to go and spearhead some really big, risky initiatives,” says Childers of Chief, a private women's network whose mission is to drive more women into positions of power.

“I don't love the deglobalization word,” Scott Kapnick says

If y ou're not a fan of the word  “deglobalization ,” which has been a popular phrase to describe diminishing global integration, Scott Kapnick , the founder & CEO of HPS Investment Partners, agrees. In the latest episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t1d86e2c4,6c455af1,655b07aa Talks at GS , Kapnick says the term global “realignment” is more appropriate. But he doesn't downplay its impact on global supply chains, growth and the level of uncertainty in the world right now. 

“The big issue with deglobalization is the focus now on resiliency of supply chain. So, we're a lender. We want to focus on how people are doing that,” Kapnick tells host  Alison Mass .
