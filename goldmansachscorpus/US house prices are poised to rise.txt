Why US home prices are expected to climb in 2024

Housing prices in the US were surprisingly resilient last year in the face of a jump in mortgage rates. Now, with the prospect of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a50f interest rate cuts  on the horizon, home prices are expected to climb more than previously anticipated,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a510 according to Goldman Sachs Research . 

US home prices are projected to increase 5% this year, up from the previous forecast of 1.9%, Goldman Sachs Research's Roger Ashworth, senior strategist on the structured credit team, and analyst Vinay Viswanathan write in the team's report. In 2025, prices are expected to rise 3.7%, compared with the earlier forecast of 2.8%. Those forecasts are underpinned in part by signs of momentum in housing prices. 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a511 
	

Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates are expected to fall to 6.3% by the end of this year, making homes slightly more affordable. 

Ashworth and Viswanathan point out that the very low inventory of houses for sale props up prices, as does generally stable demand. 

Meanwhile, US housing affordability is still low on a historical basis, and it's still cheaper to rent than to buy. Mortgage affordability is expected to improve only slightly in the near term. 	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

	

The headwinds of inflation are still blowing 	
	
	

	

The economic outlook in 2024 appears to be more positive as the probability of a recession in the US fades, says David Solomon, CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs, on an episode of  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a512 Goldman Sachs Exchanges . But there are still plenty of challenges. For one, rising geopolitical risks and a packed global election calendar are creating uncertainty, which could give rise to more volatility and delay investment decisions. And while inflation has meaningfully abated, higher housing and energy prices could keep inflation higher than the market expects, he adds.

“I'm not quite as bullish as everyone else that we're going to see a series of cuts this year and we're going back to an environment of much, much lower interest rates,” Solomon says. “I think we have a significant number of headwinds [that] are going to still keep interest rates higher for longer.” 

Nevertheless, a more benign economic environment is giving companies more confidence to move forward with much-delayed strategic decisions and M&A activity, which Solomon expects to pick up in 2024. “We haven't seen a recession. There's a higher probability of a softer landing. And so naturally, people are regaining confidence and, therefore, the transaction activity, the financing, the investment, the deal-making activity is starting to pick up.” 

	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

	

Fighting climate change, farm by farm 	
	
	

	

	

Reducing our dependence on fossil fuels is vital to the battle against climate change. But it isn't enough — not while the world's food systems are responsible for 30% of all emissions, says Jennifer Morris, the CEO of The Nature Conservancy,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a514 in a Goldman Sachs Talks session  with Anna Skoglund, head of the Financial and Strategic Investors Group in EMEA at Goldman Sachs. "We have to focus on the transition in agriculture and food production," Morris says. “Agriculture is driving 80% of deforestation around the world, and 70% of our global water withdrawals are coming from agriculture.”

Farmers, ranchers, and food producers worldwide are now beginning to understand the need for sustainable agricultural practices — not only as a climate initiative, but also to protect their business models. Drought and changing rainfall patterns from a warming climate are affecting crop production and yields globally, while supply chains and livelihoods are being hit, Morris said. “Companies see that and are stepping up, but there's still a lot more that needs to happen," she says. 

For a roadmap, the agriculture sector can look to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a516 the energy transition  unfolding in parallel. At the outset, Morris says, even several climate experts thought renewables would always be too expensive to compete with cheaper, “dirtier” fossil fuels like coal. "Now here we are 10–15 years later, and we know that renewable energy in some places is cost-competitive, if not less [costly], than some sources of fossil fuels," Morris says. 

Developing countries seeking to protect their land and water resources frequently face a steep hurdle: debt distress. Through its Nature Bonds program, The Nature Conservancy works with underwriters and financial development corporations to restructure sovereign debt, using a portion of the refinancing proceeds to fund conservation. Belize, for example, was on the brink of default, before the program reduced the country's debt burden by 11% and improved its credit rating. "There's a real interest in trying to create new instruments that work better for countries that are in debt distress and, quite frankly, climate distress," Morris says. 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Forecast change: US GDP is now predicted to grow faster than expected 	
	
	

	

	

Goldman Sachs Research edged up its forecasts for US economic growth on stronger-than-expected real (inflation-adjusted) spending from state and local governments. Those expenditures are supported by stronger-than-expected revenue growth, the bipartisan infrastructure law, and the depletion of built-up fiscal reserves, Goldman Sachs Research economist Tim Krupa writes in the team's report. 

Our economists raised their forecast for state and local spending in 2024, which boosts its projection for GDP expansion by 0.3 percentage point in each of the next two quarters — to 2.5% in the first quarter of 2024 and 2.2% in the second quarter of 2024 (quarter-over-quarter, annualized). That increases our economists' 2024 GDP forecast by 0.1 percentage point to 2.1% (fourth quarter, year-over-year).

But it isn't enough — not while the world's food systems are responsible for 30% of all emissions, says Jennifer Morris, the CEO of The Nature Conservancy,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a514 in a Goldman Sachs Talks session  with Anna Skoglund, head of the Financial and Strategic Investors Group in EMEA at Goldman Sachs. "We have to focus on the transition in agriculture and food production," Morris says. “Agriculture is driving 80% of deforestation around the world, and 70% of our global water withdrawals are coming from agriculture.”

Farmers, ranchers, and food producers worldwide are now beginning to understand the need for sustainable agricultural practices — not only as a climate initiative, but also to protect their business models. Drought and changing rainfall patterns from a warming climate are affecting crop production and yields globally, while supply chains and livelihoods are being hit, Morris said. “Companies see that and are stepping up, but there's still a lot more that needs to happen," she says. 

For a roadmap, the agriculture sector can look to  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t28ddb0fa,85f16600,6567a516 the energy transition  unfolding in parallel. At the outset, Morris says, even several climate experts thought renewables would always be too expensive to compete with cheaper, “dirtier” fossil fuels like coal. "Now here we are 10–15 years later, and we know that renewable energy in some places is cost-competitive, if not less [costly], than some sources of fossil fuels," Morris says. 

Developing countries seeking to protect their land and water resources frequently face a steep hurdle: debt distress. Through its Nature Bonds program, The Nature Conservancy works with underwriters and financial development corporations to restructure sovereign debt, using a portion of the refinancing proceeds to fund conservation. Belize, for example, was on the brink of default, before the program reduced the country's debt burden by 11% and improved its credit rating. "There's a real interest in trying to create new instruments that work better for countries that are in debt distress and, quite frankly, climate distress," Morris says. 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Forecast change: US GDP is now predicted to grow faster than expected 	
	
	

	

	

Goldman Sachs Research edged up its forecasts for US economic growth on stronger-than-expected real (inflation-adjusted) spending from state and local governments. Those expenditures are supported by stronger-than-expected revenue growth, the bipartisan infrastructure law, and the depletion of built-up fiscal reserves, Goldman Sachs Research economist Tim Krupa writes in the team's report. 

Our economists raised their forecast for state and local spending in 2024, which boosts its projection for GDP expansion by 0.3 percentage point in each of the next two quarters — to 2.5% in the first quarter of 2024 and 2.2% in the second quarter of 2024 (quarter-over-quarter, annualized). That increases our economists' 2024 GDP forecast by 0.1 percentage point to 2.1% (fourth quarter, year-over-year).
