The probability of a US recession has fallen 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcde6 

The likelihood of a US recession in the coming year has declined amid signs of a still-solid job market,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcde7 according to Goldman Sachs Research . 

Our economists say there's a 15% chance of recession in the next 12 months, down from their earlier projection of 20%. That's in line with the unconditional long-term average probability of 15%, writes Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm's chief economist, in the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcde8 team's report . 

The most important reason for the forecast change is that the US unemployment rate fell to 4.051% in September — below the level in July, when the rate jumped to 4.253%, and marginally below the June level of 4.054%. The unemployment rate is also below the threshold that activates the “Sahm rule,” which identifies signals that can indicate the start of a recession. The rule is triggered when the three-month average US unemployment rate increases by 0.50% or more from its low during the previous 12 months.

Recent employment data brings job market signals into line with broader economic growth signals. Real GDP grew 3% in the second quarter and an estimated 3.2% in the third quarter. The strong economic activity data and the recent rebound in oil prices on fears of escalation from the Middle East conflict haven't changed Goldman Sach Research's conviction that inflation will cool further. 

If US Federal Reserve officials had known what was coming, the Federal Open Market Committee might have cut rates by 25 basis points on September 18 instead of 50 basis points, Hatzius writes. But that doesn't mean it was a mistake. “We think the FOMC was late to start cutting, so a catch-up that brings the funds rate closer to the levels of around 4% implied by standard policy rules makes sense even in hindsight,” Hatzius writes. 

The latest jobs data strengthens Goldman Sachs Research's conviction that the next few FOMC meetings (including November 6-7) will bring smaller 25 basis point cuts. Our economists expect the Fed to reduce rates to a terminal funds rate of 3.25% - 3.5%.

What the Middle East conflict means for oil prices 	
	
	

	

Geopolitical risks are likely to drive oil prices higher, at least in the short term, explains Goldman Sachs' Co-Head of Commodities Research Daan Struyven. “The risks in the short term are skewed somewhat to the upside, not only because of the possibility of supply disruptions in the Middle East, but also because…if you look at speculative positioning, you're in the lowest 1% of history,”  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdeb  he tells Goldman Sachs Exchanges host Allison Nathan . 
	
	
	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdec 

Over the long term — assuming no major escalation in the region — oil prices could fall given spare capacity and the risks from trade tariffs, he notes. “High spare capacity probably limits the upside over longer horizons because if you give OPEC enough time and if they can bring the barrels back, that should limit the tightening effects,” he says. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

A strong economy is driving a higher earnings forecast for the S&P in 2025 	
	
	

	

Ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, Goldman Sachs Research raised its S&P 500 earnings-per-share forecast for 2025 to $268, up from a previous estimate of $256. Our analysts also introduced a 2026 estimate of $288 and left their 2024 full-year estimate unchanged at $241. 
  
	
	
	

	
  
	

The upward revision of the 2025 forecast — a 11% year-on-year rise — is driven primarily by greater margin expansion, David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' chief US equity strategist, writes in his team's report. He attributes his expectation of 78 basis points of net margin expansion in 2025 — compared with 24 basis points in a previous estimate — in large part because of a strong economy. 

“From a top-down perspective, our economists' forecast for US GDP growth is above consensus,” Kostin writes. Goldman Sachs economists expect real US GDP growth to average 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026 (as of October 4).

European telecoms are poised for growth and consolidation 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdee 
	

The outlook is brightening for European telecommunications companies,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdef says Andrew Lee , head of the Technology, Media, and Telecom Group in Goldman Sachs Research. That's in large part because the prospects for greater pricing power and industry consolidation have improved as regulators focus more on Europe's competitiveness. 

This is bullish news for an industry characterized by slow or no growth for years. The improving outlook isn't yet fully reflected in consensus forecasts or investor expectations, Lee said after Goldman Sachs' European Communacopia Conference. 

Lee notes that Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank, was a major conversation topic. Draghi's report on how to improve EU competitiveness suggests that regulators need to allow greater market concentration to incentivize investment and support growth. Draghi highlighted European mobile services as one sector where they can do that. 

“What we heard from all our company operators is that they think things have definitively changed,” Lee says. “There's a high likelihood that we will see attempts at consolidation to test this apparent new regulatory stance in the coming months and years.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Generative AI has the potential to deflate the software industry 	
	
	

	

As generative AI models get better, they could be used to develop software more efficiently than traditional processes, enabling businesses to replace today's packaged software with AI-powered solutions. “This could reduce the economic power and influence of many of today's software companies — which are primarily US-based — relative to other companies and industries, and lead to economic drags in countries that are exporters of software and development services,” writes Matt Lucas, who works with the Technology, Media, and Telecom group in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets and is a 2024 member of the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdf0 Goldman Sachs Global Institute's  fellows program. 

Already, AI is automating significant aspects of coding, testing, and maintenance. At the same time, IT customers are tightening their software budgets and prioritizing investments in infrastructure, including hyperscale cloud, semiconductors, and systems. At the lower end of the software industry, these trends may result in more consolidation among software companies, writes Lucas. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

A deflated software industry could have several economic and geopolitical effects: 

	- Countries outside the US could attempt to further reduce their reliance on US software. If generative AI models make it easier to replace packaged and often-imported software products, the leverage of the US in matters of technology could be diminished. 

	- As customers of today's software companies replace products with AI-generated alternatives, the software industry's profits may come under pressure. The potential knock-on effects of this upheaval could be massive: in the US, as of 2020, software companies represented around 27% of domestic business R&D spend, and nearly 1 in 10 jobs attaches to the software economy.  

	- Demand for offshore development services may shrink. This could result in reallocation of profit away from countries that are exporters of software and IT services, notably including the US and India, with corresponding implications for economic growth. 

In this challenging environment, the software industry will likely consolidate as companies look to achieve economies of scale in capital, data sets, and customer relationships. “We are seeing increasing interest in this trend develop among both public and VC-backed software companies,” Lucas writes.

The unemployment rate is also below the threshold that activates the “Sahm rule,” which identifies signals that can indicate the start of a recession.

Geopolitical risks are likely to drive oil prices higher, at least in the short term, explains Goldman Sachs' Co-Head of Commodities Research Daan Struyven. “The risks in the short term are skewed somewhat to the upside, not only because of the possibility of supply disruptions in the Middle East, but also because…if you look at speculative positioning, you're in the lowest 1% of history,”  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdeb  he tells Goldman Sachs Exchanges host Allison Nathan .

The probability of a US recession has fallen 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcde6 

The likelihood of a US recession in the coming year has declined amid signs of a still-solid job market,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcde7 according to Goldman Sachs Research . 

Our economists say there's a 15% chance of recession in the next 12 months, down from their earlier projection of 20%. That's in line with the unconditional long-term average probability of 15%, writes Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs Research and the firm's chief economist, in the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcde8 team's report . 

The most important reason for the forecast change is that the US unemployment rate fell to 4.051% in September — below the level in July, when the rate jumped to 4.253%, and marginally below the June level of 4.054%. The unemployment rate is also below the threshold that activates the “Sahm rule,” which identifies signals that can indicate the start of a recession. The rule is triggered when the three-month average US unemployment rate increases by 0.50% or more from its low during the previous 12 months.

Recent employment data brings job market signals into line with broader economic growth signals. Real GDP grew 3% in the second quarter and an estimated 3.2% in the third quarter. The strong economic activity data and the recent rebound in oil prices on fears of escalation from the Middle East conflict haven't changed Goldman Sach Research's conviction that inflation will cool further. 

If US Federal Reserve officials had known what was coming, the Federal Open Market Committee might have cut rates by 25 basis points on September 18 instead of 50 basis points, Hatzius writes. But that doesn't mean it was a mistake. “We think the FOMC was late to start cutting, so a catch-up that brings the funds rate closer to the levels of around 4% implied by standard policy rules makes sense even in hindsight,” Hatzius writes. 

The latest jobs data strengthens Goldman Sachs Research's conviction that the next few FOMC meetings (including November 6-7) will bring smaller 25 basis point cuts. Our economists expect the Fed to reduce rates to a terminal funds rate of 3.25% - 3.5%.

What the Middle East conflict means for oil prices 	
	
	

	

Geopolitical risks are likely to drive oil prices higher, at least in the short term, explains Goldman Sachs' Co-Head of Commodities Research Daan Struyven. “The risks in the short term are skewed somewhat to the upside, not only because of the possibility of supply disruptions in the Middle East, but also because…if you look at speculative positioning, you're in the lowest 1% of history,”  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdeb  he tells Goldman Sachs Exchanges host Allison Nathan . 
	
	
	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdec 

Over the long term — assuming no major escalation in the region — oil prices could fall given spare capacity and the risks from trade tariffs, he notes. “High spare capacity probably limits the upside over longer horizons because if you give OPEC enough time and if they can bring the barrels back, that should limit the tightening effects,” he says. 
	
	
	

	

	

	
	
	

	

A strong economy is driving a higher earnings forecast for the S&P in 2025 	
	
	

	

Ahead of the third-quarter earnings season, Goldman Sachs Research raised its S&P 500 earnings-per-share forecast for 2025 to $268, up from a previous estimate of $256. Our analysts also introduced a 2026 estimate of $288 and left their 2024 full-year estimate unchanged at $241. 
  
	
	
	

	
  
	

The upward revision of the 2025 forecast — a 11% year-on-year rise — is driven primarily by greater margin expansion, David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' chief US equity strategist, writes in his team's report. He attributes his expectation of 78 basis points of net margin expansion in 2025 — compared with 24 basis points in a previous estimate — in large part because of a strong economy. 

“From a top-down perspective, our economists' forecast for US GDP growth is above consensus,” Kostin writes. Goldman Sachs economists expect real US GDP growth to average 2.3% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026 (as of October 4).

European telecoms are poised for growth and consolidation 	
	
	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdee 
	

The outlook is brightening for European telecommunications companies,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdef says Andrew Lee , head of the Technology, Media, and Telecom Group in Goldman Sachs Research. That's in large part because the prospects for greater pricing power and industry consolidation have improved as regulators focus more on Europe's competitiveness. 

This is bullish news for an industry characterized by slow or no growth for years. The improving outlook isn't yet fully reflected in consensus forecasts or investor expectations, Lee said after Goldman Sachs' European Communacopia Conference. 

Lee notes that Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank, was a major conversation topic. Draghi's report on how to improve EU competitiveness suggests that regulators need to allow greater market concentration to incentivize investment and support growth. Draghi highlighted European mobile services as one sector where they can do that. 

“What we heard from all our company operators is that they think things have definitively changed,” Lee says. “There's a high likelihood that we will see attempts at consolidation to test this apparent new regulatory stance in the coming months and years.” 
	
	
	

	

	
	
	

	

Generative AI has the potential to deflate the software industry 	
	
	

	

As generative AI models get better, they could be used to develop software more efficiently than traditional processes, enabling businesses to replace today's packaged software with AI-powered solutions. “This could reduce the economic power and influence of many of today's software companies — which are primarily US-based — relative to other companies and industries, and lead to economic drags in countries that are exporters of software and development services,” writes Matt Lucas, who works with the Technology, Media, and Telecom group in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets and is a 2024 member of the   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t302f2819,909febe0,656fcdf0 Goldman Sachs Global Institute's  fellows program. 

Already, AI is automating significant aspects of coding, testing, and maintenance. At the same time, IT customers are tightening their software budgets and prioritizing investments in infrastructure, including hyperscale cloud, semiconductors, and systems. At the lower end of the software industry, these trends may result in more consolidation among software companies, writes Lucas. 
	
	
	

	
  
	

A deflated software industry could have several economic and geopolitical effects: 

	- Countries outside the US could attempt to further reduce their reliance on US software. If generative AI models make it easier to replace packaged and often-imported software products, the leverage of the US in matters of technology could be diminished. 

	- As customers of today's software companies replace products with AI-generated alternatives, the software industry's profits may come under pressure. The potential knock-on effects of this upheaval could be massive: in the US, as of 2020, software companies represented around 27% of domestic business R&D spend, and nearly 1 in 10 jobs attaches to the software economy.  

	- Demand for offshore development services may shrink. This could result in reallocation of profit away from countries that are exporters of software and IT services, notably including the US and India, with corresponding implications for economic growth. 

In this challenging environment, the software industry will likely consolidate as companies look to achieve economies of scale in capital, data sets, and customer relationships. “We are seeing increasing interest in this trend develop among both public and VC-backed software companies,” Lucas writes.
