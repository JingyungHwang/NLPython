How global trade is shifting amid rising US tariffs 	
	
	

	

	

The US import tariffs announced this year are unprecedented in the modern era, exceeding those of the first Trump administration, when several rounds of import duties were imposed on China and other countries starting in 2018. 

US retailers expect a drop of 20-30% in imports in the coming months,   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36707ce4,9943508d,657624a7 writes Patrick Creuset , senior analyst for European transport, infrastructure, and construction sectors at Goldman Sachs Research, in a report. A decline of that scale in US import cargo volumes forms Creuset's base case, and it assumes tariffs stay mostly as they are, with China remaining as the focus, although that is far from certain. 
	
	
	

	

	
 https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36707ce4,9943508d,657624a8 
	

How might the current phase of tariffs differ from, or resemble, previous episodes of trade tensions?  

Difference:  Given the recent imposition of US import tariffs, the trade disruption that's imminent is beyond what was seen during President Donald Trump's first term. Asia-US trade has only fallen three times in the past quarter century. This time, the decline in trade could be deeper, especially if US policymakers are willing to accept slower GDP growth and higher inflation. 

Similarity:  The earlier round of tariffs on China had prompted the rerouting of goods through other countries such as Vietnam or Mexico. This is likely to happen again. The incentive to pursue such roundabout routes is, if anything, stronger than before because of the huge differential between the tariffs levied on China and those levied on its Asian neighbors. 

Similarity:  In the same way that previous tariffs didn't shift the center of gravity away from Asia, the US is likely to remain highly dependent on Chinese and Asian trade for a long time. Creuset's team points out that China's manufacturing workforce is approximately five times as large as those in the US, Mexico, and Canada combined. 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	

Quoted: The dollar's depreciation 	
	
	

	

	
  
	

	

"Dollar depreciation should not be confused with loss of the dollar's status as the world's dominant currency. Barring extreme shocks, we think the dollar's advantages as a global medium of exchange and store of value are too entrenched for other currencies to overcome. We have had large exchange rate moves without loss of the dollar's dominant status in the past, and our baseline expectation is that the current move will be no different." 

— Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs , writes in a  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36707ce4,9943508d,657624a9 Markets Insights editorial in the Financial Times . 🔒 
	
	
	

	

	

	

	
	
	

	

The outlook for S&P 500 company spending 	
	
	

	

As S&P 500 companies report their quarterly earnings, investors are focused on whether the uncertain policy environment will lead companies to reduce the pace of their cash spending. Company cash investments can include research and development,  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36707ce4,9943508d,657624aa mergers and acquisitions , capital expenditure, dividend payments, and share buybacks. 

Among S&P 500 companies, every 100-point increase in the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index correlates to a roughly 10% reduction in cash spending growth, all else being equal, writes Ryan Hammond, a US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research. The US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has risen from 167 in January to 455 in April.  
	
	
	

	
  
	

Hammond's team has reduced its forecast for cash spending by S&P 500 companies to 5% growth this year, down from 11% previously. The reduction reflects higher uncertainty and weaker earnings growth, Hammond writes in a recent note. 

The team expects the strongest spending growth to be in capital expenditure, which is forecast to increase 9% in 2025. Without hyperscale tech companies engaged in  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36707ce4,9943508d,657624ab artificial intelligence , though, that figure would stand at just 1%. A consensus of analyst estimates suggests capital expenditure growth among hyperscalers will decelerate from 55% in 2024 to 36% in 2025. 

Elsewhere, our analysts expect more modest growth in R&D, buybacks, and dividends than was estimated before the series of tariff announcements by the US this year. They anticipate that completed cash M&A among S&P 500 firms will decline by 10% in 2025.  

The dampening effect of uncertainty is typically most pronounced on buybacks and cash M&A, Hammond writes, because “these two uses of cash tend to be the most volatile and are adjusted most frequently based on the operating environment.” 

Investor preference for corporate uses of cash typically varies based on the stage of the  https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36707ce4,9943508d,657624ac economic cycle . With our economists forecasting just 0.5% real GDP growth in the US this year and with interest rates on 10-year US Treasury bond yields still high at 4.2% (as of April 30), Hammond expects investors to avoid companies with either weak balance sheets or debts that could be vulnerable to high borrowing costs. He also believes investors will favor companies that return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends over companies that invest in their own operations with a view to driving future growth. “This pattern typically occurs when economic growth is slowing or potentially entering recession and has repeated in recent months”, he writes.

Marco Poletti (L) with Allison Nathan on Goldman Sachs Exchanges. 
	
	
	

	

The cybersecurity sector has emerged as one of the bright spots in deal-making. In the latest episode of   https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=t36707ce4,9943508d,657624af Goldman Sachs Exchanges , Marco Poletti, global head of Security Software in Goldman Sachs' investment banking business, explains how generative artificial intelligence and rising geopolitical tensions are reshaping the sector and leading to a surge in M&A.  

“It's just a much more dangerous world when you think about the number of cyber attacks,” Poletti tells Exchanges host Allison Nathan. “There's more and more of them and it just keeps on coming, and that means we need better security.” Rising geopolitical tensions and conflicts also typically translate into more cyber attacks, while gen AI – which is spurring a wave of innovation – is also creating “a huge attack surface.”  

That's one of the factors pushing big tech companies to invest in cybersecurity, since they view strong defenses as a competitive advantage, he notes. Vendors are responding by offering multiple services on one platform, which is in turn  fueling strategic acquisitions as companies look to add new capabilities to their stable of services, he notes.

<p lang=3D"EN-US"><span style=3D"font-size:16px"><strong>Difference:</stron=
g> Given the recent imposition of US import tariffs, the trade disruption t=
hat's imminent is beyond what was seen during President Donald Trump's firs=
t term. Asia-US trade has only fallen three times in the past quarter centu=
ry. This time, the decline in trade could be deeper, especially if US polic=

></p><p lang=3D"EN-US"><span style=3D"font-size:16px"><strong>Similarity:</=
strong> The earlier round of tariffs on China had prompted the rerouting of=
 goods through other countries such as Vietnam or Mexico. This is likely to=
 happen again. The incentive to pursue such roundabout routes is, if anythi=
ng, stronger than before because of the huge differential between the tarif=
fs levied on China and those levied on its Asian neighbors.</span></p>
<p lang=3D"EN-US"><span style=3D"font-size:16px"><strong>Similarity:</stron=
g> In the same way that previous tariffs didn't shift the center of gravity=
 away from Asia, the US is likely to remain highly dependent on Chinese and=
 Asian trade for a long time. Creuset's team points out that China's manufa=
cturing workforce is approximately five times as large as those in the US, =
